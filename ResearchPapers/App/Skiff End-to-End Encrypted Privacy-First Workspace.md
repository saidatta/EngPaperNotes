- **Encryption Schema**: Utilizes public-key authenticated encryption for secure sharing of encrypted documents. Each user receives a set of public and private keys for signing and encryption, generated using Curve25519.
- **Encryption Library**: Uses tweetnacl-js for asymmetric (tweetnacl.box) and secret-key (tweetnacl.secretbox) authenticated encryption, ensuring confidentiality and authenticity (AEAD).
- **Key Management**: Public keys are shareable for sending or verifying information, while private keys, crucial for decryption and signature generation, remain confidential.
---
#### 3.2 Login, Creating Accounts, and Private Key Storage
- **Account Creation Process**:
  1. Secure password generation and in-browser keypair generation using tweetnacl.js.
  2. Derivation of a symmetric key from the user's password using Argon2id and HKDF, creating separate keys for login and encrypting user secrets.
  3. Encryption of user's private keys (not the password) with the derived key for server storage, ensuring that decryption is only possible in-browser.
- **Authentication Protocol**: Uses Secure Remote Password (SRP) for login, enhancing security against brute-force and dictionary attacks. User login results in access to encrypted user data and a time-limited JWT for document access.
---
#### 3.3 Crypto Wallet Login
- **Integration with Crypto Wallets**: Supports login/signup using MetaMask and Brave Wallet, leveraging Ethereum public keys for authentication and encrypted password storage.
- **Authentication Model**: Employs a challenge-response mechanism via digital signatures to prevent impersonation and man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Potential for Expansion**: Aims to introduce private collaboration tools to the crypto community, acknowledging limitations with wallets that lack native encryption/decryption capabilities.
---
#### 3.4 Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
- **Implementation**: Offers optional setup of 2FA using authenticator apps like Authy, Google Authenticator, and Duo Mobile.
- **Security Process**: Involves generating a 2FA secret in-browser, which is then encrypted by Skiff and stored for future logins. This approach adds a layer of security against phishing and unauthorized access.
- **WebAuthN Integration**: Mentioned as a potential additional verification method, enhancing the security framework.
---
#### 3.5 Account Recovery and Password Changes
- **Recovery Mechanism**: Utilizes a recovery key (similar to the password_derived_secret) for encrypting user data, allowing for account recovery and password reset via email verification.

#### 4.2 Opening a Document (d1)
- **Procedure**:
  1. Bob retrieves his encrypted copy of `session_key_d_1`, encrypted with his public key.
  2. Using his private key, Bob decrypts this session key.
  3. With the decrypted session key, Bob can access and edit document `d1`.
---
#### 4.3 Sharing a Document (d2)
- **Process**:
  1. Alice intends to share document `d2` with Charlie and retrieves Charlie's public key.
  2. Alice encrypts `session_key_d2` with Charlieâ€™s public key and sends it for Charlie's future access, along with a signature.
  3. Charlie, upon signing in, accesses the encrypted session key and, after decryption, can read and edit `d2`.
---
#### 5. Real-time Collaboration

- **Mechanism**: Utilizes CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) for seamless real-time collaboration, ensuring that document updates are synchronized among collaborators in an encrypted manner.
- **Collaboration Flow**:
  - Collaborators establish WebSocket connections to a shared "room," identified by the document's unique ID.
  - Updates are broadcasted and received through this connection, encrypted with the document's session key.
  - Each collaborator applies updates to their local copy, leading to a consistent final document version across all users.
