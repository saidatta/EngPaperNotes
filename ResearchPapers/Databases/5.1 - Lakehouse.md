## Introduction and Motivation
- Traditional data warehouses have been the **go-to** for BI & analytics, but now face problems:
  1. **Rigid schema-on-write** approach.  
  2. **Expensive** for large-scale unstructured data.  
  3. **Lack of built-in support for advanced analytics** such as ML.  

- In parallel, **data lakes** have emerged as cheap, scalable storage (e.g., S3, HDFS) for **raw** structured, semi-structured, or unstructured data.  
- However, a typical **two-tier architecture** using both a data lake and a separate data warehouse is **complex** and **error-prone**:
  - Data becomes **stale** (ETL or ELT adds latency).  
  - Pipeline reliability issues with repeated transformations.  
  - High **TCO** (total cost of ownership) from storing data redundantly.

**Key Idea**: The **Lakehouse** approach unifies these domains in a **single** system with the performance and reliability of data warehouses **and** the open, flexible data formats of data lakes.

---

## Background: Data Warehouses vs. Data Lakes

### 1. Data Warehouses (DW)
- **Characteristics**:
  - Typically proprietary data format & engine.  
  - Schema-on-write ensures **structured** data ingestion.  
  - Strong ACID semantics, indexing, transactions, etc.  
  - Optimized for **BI and analytical** queries.

### 2. Data Lakes (DL)
- **Characteristics**:
  - Store raw data (structured, semi-structured, unstructured).  
  - Typically rely on open formats (e.g., Parquet, ORC).  
  - **Schema-on-read** approach: flexible but adds complexity for governance.  
  - Usually no native ACID transactions or indexing.  
  - Used heavily for **ML, data science**, and cheap storage.

### Two-Tier Architecture
- Data is **ingested** into the data lake first and then (sometimes) into a data warehouse.  
- Requires **redundant ETL/ELT** steps—time-consuming, error-prone, and leads to **stale** data in the warehouse.

---

## Challenges with the Two-Tier Architecture

1. **Reliability**  
   - Maintaining consistency between data lake & warehouse is complicated.  
   - **Multiple ETL jobs** increase risk of data quality issues.

2. **Data Staleness**  
   - Batch ETL processes mean data might not be immediately available in the warehouse.  
   - “Real-time” or near-real-time analytics is hindered.

3. **Limited Support for Advanced Analytics**  
   - ML and data science workloads need direct, high-throughput access to data.  
   - Warehouses typically only provide **SQL** or ODBC/JDBC access.  
   - Data scientists often **extract** data again → more delay & duplication.

4. **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)**  
   - Storing data in both data lake **and** data warehouse doubles storage costs.  
   - Proprietary DW formats can lead to **vendor lock-in** and hamper migrations.

## The Lakehouse Architecture

**Definition**: A **Lakehouse** is a **data management system** that:  
1. Stores data in **open file formats** in cheap, directly accessible storage (e.g., cloud object stores like S3).  
2. Offers **warehouse-like management features**: ACID transactions, data versioning, indexing, caching, etc.  
3. Provides **high-performance** SQL and BI capabilities **and** direct support for ML/data science on the same data.
---
### Metadata Layer for Data Management
- **Core Insight**: Manage large data sets “as files” but keep a **transaction log** in the data lake itself.  
  - E.g., [**Delta Lake**](https://delta.io/), [**Apache Iceberg**](https://iceberg.apache.org/), [**Apache Hudi**](https://hudi.apache.org/).  
- **Key Features**:
  1. **ACID transactions** (especially on top of object stores like S3).  
  2. **Data versioning** (time-travel, rollback).  
  3. **Schema enforcement** (schema evolution with constraints).  
  4. **Data governance** (fine-grained access, auditing).  
- **Example**: In **Delta Lake**, a transaction log (often stored in Parquet or JSON) tracks which files make up each version of the table.  
  - This approach allows “zero-copy cloning,” time-travel queries, and more.  
#### Research Directions
- **Performance**: scaling transaction logs to billions of files.  
- **Cross-table transactions** (currently limited in some engines).  
- **Metadata store choices**: storing transaction logs in object store vs. external DB.  

---
### Achieving High SQL Performance
One might worry that using an **open file format** prevents the system from optimizing deeply, but the paper shows multiple techniques:
1. **Caching**  
   - Hot subsets of data can be cached in memory or SSD, often in a fully optimized format.  
   - Validity is ensured by the transaction logs.

2. **Auxiliary Data Structures**  
   - **Indexes**, zone maps, min-max column stats, bloom filters, etc.  
   - Stored separately, so base data remains in a standard open format.  
   - Query engines can skip large file ranges based on stats.

3. **Data Layout**  
   - Clustering or partitioning by frequently accessed columns.  
   - Z-order or Hilbert curve layouts for multi-dimensional data skipping.  
   - Can remain within Parquet or ORC specs, but physically reorder data for better localities.

4. **Modern Query Engine Optimizations**  
   - Vectorized execution, predicate pushdown, JIT compilation.  
   - For example, **Delta Engine** (Databricks) uses a C++-based engine for Spark.

**Example**: If a table is partitioned or “Z-ordered” by `country` and `date`, queries with predicates on these columns can avoid scanning irrelevant data blocks.

### Support for Advanced Analytics and ML

- **Challenge**: ML & data science typically require large-scale data reads in custom (non-SQL) code.  
- **Solution**: A Lakehouse can provide:
  1. **Direct reading** of open-format files (Parquet, ORC) by ML frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Spark ML).  
  2. **Declarative APIs** (DataFrames) that push down projections/filters into the Lakehouse engine.  
  3. **Transaction support** & versioning → consistent training sets (“time travel” or “snapshot-based” training).  
  4. **Feature store** or other advanced data-management for ML can be built on top.

**Code Snippet**: Example Spark-like pseudo-Python using Delta Lake for ML:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("Lakehouse-ML-Demo") \
    .getOrCreate()

# Read a table in Delta Lake format
users = spark.read.format("delta").load("/lakehouse/users_delta/")

# Simple filter (predicate pushdown)
buyers = users.filter(users.kind == "buyer").select("date", "zip", "price")

# Use in MLlib (assuming we have a regression scenario)
train_data = buyers.fillna(0)  # fill null with 0, etc.
# ... further feature engineering ...

# Fit an MLlib model
from pyspark.ml.regression import LinearRegression

lr = LinearRegression(featuresCol="features", labelCol="price")
model = lr.fit(train_data)

# Time-travel example: read older version
old_users = spark.read.format("delta").option("versionAsOf", 10).load("/lakehouse/users_delta/")
```

> *Note*: This snippet demonstrates how **DataFrame transforms** can be optimized by the underlying Lakehouse engine (e.g., skipping irrelevant partitions).

## Performance: TPC-DS Benchmark Highlights

- The paper reports **TPC-DS** results (scale factor 30K) comparing:  
  - **Delta Engine** (Lakehouse)  
  - Multiple **cloud data warehouse** solutions (DW1, DW2, etc.)  
- Key Observations:  
  1. Lakehouse approach can be **competitive** or **faster** on aggregate query execution times.  
  2. Overall **cost** can be **lower**, especially if spot instances are used.  
- **Example Table** (Adapted from paper):

| System      | Power Test (sec) | Total Cost (USD) |
|-------------|------------------|------------------|
| DW1         | 7143             | 600              |
| DW2         | 2996             | 400              |
| DW3         | 37283            | 206              |
| DW4         | 5793             | 570              |
| DeltaEngine (on-demand) | 3302   | 104              |
| DeltaEngine (spot)      | 3252   | 56               |

> These results illustrate that **open-format** Lakehouse systems can achieve near state-of-the-art performance and price-performance.
