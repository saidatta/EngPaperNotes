Below is a **continuation** of the notes on “OS: Sending and Receiving Data,” adding more advanced details about **blocking vs. non-blocking I/O**, **partial reads/writes**, **error handling**, and relevant **socket options**. Everything is formatted in **Obsidian-friendly Markdown**, ready for your vault.

In the previous notes, we looked at the fundamentals of sending and receiving data via socket file descriptors, along with kernel buffers, Nagle’s algorithm, zero-copy, etc. Let’s dig deeper into **partial reads/writes**, **blocking vs. non-blocking I/O**, and **advanced socket flags**.

---

## 1. Blocking vs. Non-Blocking I/O

### 1.1 Blocking Mode (Default)
- By default, sockets are **blocking**. A `read()` call waits (blocks) until data arrives or the connection closes.  
- A `write()` call blocks if the **send buffer** is full, resuming only after enough data has been transmitted (or buffer space freed) to accommodate the new data.

**Pros**:
- Simpler logic for many applications.  
- Your code only proceeds once data is actually read/written.

**Cons**:
- A slow or stalled peer can cause your process to wait indefinitely (or until a timeout).

### 1.2 Non-Blocking Mode
- In **non-blocking** mode, system calls like `read()` or `write()` **return immediately**:
  - **`EAGAIN`** or **`EWOULDBLOCK`** if there’s no data available (for `read()`) or the send buffer is full (for `write()`).  
- This is often used in **event-driven** servers (e.g., Node.js under the hood, or Java NIO) or when using **select/poll/epoll**.

**Pros**:
- One process/thread can handle many connections by reacting to I/O events.  
- Avoids being stuck if a socket is slow or if the buffer is full.

**Cons**:
- More complex state machine: you must handle partial reads/writes, `EAGAIN`, and keep track of how much data was written vs. how much is left.

### 1.3 Setting Non-Blocking
```c
#include <fcntl.h>

int make_socket_non_blocking(int fd) {
    int flags = fcntl(fd, F_GETFL, 0);
    if (flags == -1) return -1;
    return fcntl(fd, F_SETFL, flags | O_NONBLOCK);
}
```
- Alternatively, use **`ioctl()`** on some systems or set specific flags during socket creation.

## 2. Partial Reads & Writes

Even in **blocking** mode, system calls don’t always read or write the full requested amount:

1. **`read(fd, buf, len)`** can return fewer bytes than `len` if the kernel had less data available. You may need a loop to read everything you expect.
2. **`write(fd, buf, len)`** can also write fewer bytes if the kernel can’t take the full chunk at once (due to a nearly-full send buffer).

**Example**:
```c
ssize_t robust_write(int fd, const char *buf, size_t total) {
    size_t written = 0;
    while (written < total) {
        ssize_t rc = write(fd, buf + written, total - written);
        if (rc < 0) {
            if (errno == EINTR) continue; // interrupted, retry
            return -1; // other error
        }
        written += rc;
    }
    return written;
}
```
This loop ensures we keep calling `write()` until the full data amount is sent or an error occurs.

## 3. Advanced Socket Flags

### 3.1 `MSG_MORE`
- When using **`send()`** in Linux with the flag `MSG_MORE`, you indicate that more data will follow soon. This can help reduce small-packet overhead (similar to a manual Nagle approach) without fully enabling Nagle’s algorithm.
```c
send(sockfd, "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n", length, MSG_MORE);
send(sockfd, "Content-Length: 5\r\n\r\n", length, 0);
```
In some cases, the kernel tries to coalesce these writes into fewer packets.

### 3.2 `MSG_DONTWAIT`
- Equivalent to `O_NONBLOCK` on a per-call basis. In blocking mode, you can do a one-off non-blocking attempt:
```c
send(sockfd, buf, len, MSG_DONTWAIT);
```
If the send buffer is full, you get `EAGAIN` instead of blocking.

### 3.3 `TCP_CORK` (Linux)
- A setsockopt that “corks” the connection so the kernel buffers data until you “uncork.”  
- Typically used for sending **big** data in fewer segments but with manual control.  
- Must be combined with `TCP_NODELAY` logic for best results in certain streaming applications.

---

## 4. Error Handling & Edge Cases

### 4.1 `EINTR`
- System calls can be interrupted by signals. If you get `EINTR`, you typically retry the call.

### 4.2 `EAGAIN` / `EWOULDBLOCK`
- Occurs in **non-blocking** mode if no data is available for `read()` or if the **send buffer** is full for `write()`. You must handle it gracefully (e.g., wait for the next event from `poll`/`epoll`).

### 4.3 Connection Reset
- If the peer **resets** the connection (RST), `read()` or `write()` might return `ECONNRESET`. This can happen if the peer crashed or forcibly closed the socket.

### 4.4 Connection Close
- If the peer **cleanly** closes (FIN), a `read()` eventually returns **0**. Further `write()` calls may return `EPIPE`.

## 5. Putting It All Together: Example Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    A[write() from user space] --> B[Kernel send buffer]
    B -->|Space available? If no => block or EAGAIN| C[TCP stack]
    C -->|Segments out| D[Network]
    D --> E[Peer kernel receive buffer]
    E --> F[read() in peer app]
    F --> G[User space data]
    
    style A fill:#ffd
    style G fill:#ffd
```

**Notes**:
- If **blocking** mode and the send buffer is nearly full, `write()` may wait until space is freed.  
- In **non-blocking** mode, `write()` returns `EAGAIN` if no space is available.

## 6. Real-World Patterns

1. **Event-Driven I/O** (e.g., **epoll** on Linux, **kqueue** on BSD/macOS):  
   - Single-threaded loop calls `epoll_wait()` to see which sockets are readable/writable.  
   - Non-blocking `read()` / `write()`.  
2. **Thread-Per-Connection**:  
   - Each connection is handled by a dedicated thread. Threads block on `read()`/`write()`.  
   - Simpler code but doesn’t scale well to tens of thousands of connections.  
3. **Hybrid**:  
   - A pool of threads, each handling a subset of connections, often combined with event-based triggers.

## 7. Summary / Key Takeaways

- **Blocking vs. Non-Blocking**: Chosen based on use case (simple blocking vs. high concurrency).  
- **Partial Reads/Writes**: Always be prepared for them. Loops or state machines are common.  
- **Socket Flags**: 
  - `MSG_MORE`, `MSG_DONTWAIT`, `TCP_NODELAY`, `TCP_CORK` let you tweak performance vs. overhead trade-offs.  
- **Flow Control**: If you don’t read quickly, you throttle the sender.  
- **Error Handling**: Properly handle `EINTR`, `EAGAIN`, connection resets, etc.
