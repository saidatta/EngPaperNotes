## FAT32 Overview

### Why FAT32?
FAT32 (File Allocation Table, 32-bit) is a relatively **simple** file system design, making it an excellent example for understanding the concepts of:

- **Tables** storing file location metadata
- **Linking or chaining** LBAs (or clusters) to form the complete contents of a file
- How block (cluster) sizes affect addressing capacity
- How internal fragmentation occurs when allocating larger clusters

FAT32 was widely used in older Windows systems, USB flash drives, and SD cards due to its simplicity and cross-platform compatibility.

## Basic Concepts Recap

### LBA (Logical Block Address)
- Represents the logical addressing scheme the **device** exposes to the OS (e.g., 512 B or 4 KB).
- The OS can issue commands to read/write from LBA \(i\) to LBA \(j\).

### Cluster (a.k.a. Allocation Unit in FAT32)
- A **group** of one or more LBAs (often 4 KB total, but can vary).
- FAT32 uses the term **cluster** to manage disk space in larger chunks rather than single LBAs.
- Each cluster is identified by a **cluster number** (e.g., cluster #0, #1, #2…).

### FAT (File Allocation Table)
- A large **array of 32-bit integers** in FAT32.
- Each index in this array corresponds to a **cluster number**, and the **value** stored at that index points to the **next cluster** in the file’s chain.
- Special values for indicating **end-of-file (EOF)**, **free cluster**, or **bad cluster** also exist, consuming some bits from the 32-bit space.

---

## The Core Idea Behind FAT32

1. **FAT Array**  
   - Suppose we have an array `FAT[]`, where `FAT[i]` = cluster ID of the next cluster in a file.  
   - If `FAT[6] = 2`, it means *the cluster after cluster #6 is cluster #2*.
   - If a cluster is the **end of the file**, `FAT[i]` will hold a special value (e.g., `0xFFFFFFFF` or some sentinel that signals EOF).

2. **Directory Entry**  
   - A directory entry stores:
     - **Filename** (e.g., `TEST.TXT`)
     - **Metadata** (timestamp, attributes, etc.)
     - **Start cluster** (the first cluster of that file)
   - To read a file, you find its start cluster in the directory entry, then follow the chain in the FAT table until you reach an EOF marker.

### Example: Chaining in FAT32

Imagine a file named `TEST.TXT` starts at cluster #6:

```
Directory entry for TEST.TXT:
   ...
   Start cluster = 6
   ...
```

When you want to read the file, you:
1. Look at cluster #6 → read it.
2. Check `FAT[6]`. If `FAT[6] = 2`, that means the next cluster is #2.
3. Look at cluster #2 → read it.
4. Check `FAT[2]`. If `FAT[2] = 3`, next cluster is #3.
5. Look at cluster #3 → read it.
6. Check `FAT[3]`. Suppose `FAT[3] = 0xFFFFFFF (EOF marker)`, so you stop. You have read the entire file.

In terms of LBAs, each cluster can represent multiple LBAs. The file system logic *translates* cluster #6 into the specific LBA range on disk.

## 32-Bit? Actually ~28 Bits of Usable Space

Even though it’s called **FAT32**, not all 32 bits are free for addressing. Some are reserved for special flags (e.g., **EOF**, **bad cluster**, etc.). Typically, you get around **28 bits** for actual cluster IDs.

> **Implication**: \(2^{28}\) possible cluster IDs = 268,435,456 clusters. If each cluster was 512 bytes (i.e., 1 LBA = 512 B), you could address up to ~128 GB. For modern disks, 128 GB can be too small, so the solution is to **increase the cluster size** (e.g., 4 KB per cluster) to address more data.

---

## Clustering / Block Size

### Why Clusters?
- By grouping multiple LBAs into one **cluster**, the file system can address **larger disks** with the same number of bits.
- Example: A 4 KB cluster might consist of 8 × 512-byte LBAs.
- This **reduces** the total number of cluster entries needed, allowing us to use the same 28 bits more effectively (e.g., 4 KB × \(2^{28}\) = 1 TB+ range).

### Conversion: Cluster → LBA
If a single cluster is 8 LBAs (each LBA = 512 bytes → 4 KB total), then:
- **Cluster #0** → LBA range [0..7]
- **Cluster #1** → LBA range [8..15]
- **Cluster #6** → LBA range [48..55]  
  (Calculation: `6 * 8 = 48` → 48..(48+7)=55)

To read cluster #6, you actually issue read commands to the **underlying device** for LBAs 48 to 55. 

---

## Example Walkthrough: `TEST.TXT`

Given:
- `TEST.TXT` starts at **cluster #6**, then chains to **cluster #3**, then hits EOF.
- Each cluster is 4 KB (8 LBAs of 512 bytes each).

**Reading the file**:
1. **Read cluster #6**: 
   - This is LBAs [48..55].
   - Might require **one command** (if the OS supports a single 4 KB read).
2. Check `FAT[6]` → next cluster is #3.
3. **Read cluster #3**:
   - This is LBAs [24..31].
4. Check `FAT[3]` → next cluster is EOF.

In practice, the OS will issue two separate read commands:
- `READ(LBA=48, length=8)`  → cluster #6
- `READ(LBA=24, length=8)`  → cluster #3

> **Note**: It’s more efficient if clusters are **consecutive** so you can do fewer bigger reads. FAT32 tries to allocate files contiguously when possible.

## Internal Fragmentation in Clusters

### The Problem
If you allocate a **4 KB cluster** to a file that’s only **1 byte**, the rest of that 4 KB is **wasted** space for that file’s data. This is **internal fragmentation**.

- Example: You store `TEST.TXT` with only 1 byte. On disk, that file still occupies one whole cluster (4 KB).
- This overhead accumulates when you have **many small files**.

### Trade-Off
- **Larger cluster** = fewer entries in the FAT, bigger addressable space, but potentially **more wasted space** per file.
- **Smaller cluster** = less waste for small files, but limited total capacity and possibly more fragmentation over time.

## Demo: Creating a FAT32 Partition (Example)

> Note: The exact commands can vary by system. This is just an illustrative snippet.

```bash
# 1) List disks
lsblk

# 2) Partition disk /dev/sdb (careful: data destruction!)
sudo fdisk /dev/sdb

# Inside fdisk, create a new partition of type W95 FAT32 (LBA).
# Example steps:
#   n (new partition)
#   p (primary)
#   [accept defaults or specify size]
#   t (change partition type)
#   L (list all partition types)
#   select 0c (FAT32 LBA)
#   w (write changes)

# 3) Format the partition as FAT32
sudo mkfs.vfat -F 32 /dev/sdb1

# 4) Mount it
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/myfat32
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/myfat32

# 5) Check block/cluster info
sudo fatlabel /dev/sdb1
# or
sudo fsck.vfat -v /dev/sdb1
```

**Note**: Tools like `mkfs.vfat` may allow specifying a **cluster size**. For large partitions, mkfs automatically picks a bigger cluster to stay within FAT32 limits.

## Visualizing the FAT32 Structure

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    A[Directory Entry] -->|Start Cluster=6| B(FAT Array)
    B -->|FAT[6]=2| C(Cluster 6 Data)
    B -->|FAT[2]=3| D(Cluster 2 Data)
    B -->|FAT[3]=EOF| E(Cluster 3 Data)
    style B stroke:#f66,stroke-width:2px,stroke-dasharray: 5,5
```

- **Directory Entry** for `TEST.TXT` says: “Start at cluster #6.”
- **FAT Array** records how clusters link (6 → 2 → 3 → EOF).
- Each cluster references **LBAs** on the disk, read in chunks of 4 KB if cluster size is 4 KB.

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **FAT32 = Chained Clusters**  
   The “File Allocation Table” is a giant array of 32-bit entries linking cluster to cluster.

2. **Cluster Size Matters**  
   - Larger cluster → more disk capacity addressable, but more internal fragmentation.  
   - Smaller cluster → less space waste, but limited overall disk size.

3. **Internal Fragmentation**  
   Storing 1 byte in a 4 KB cluster “wastes” ~4095 bytes. This is analogous to how memory page allocation can cause internal fragmentation.

4. **Simple Yet Effective**  
   FAT32 is easy to implement and widely compatible, but it has limits: typically not suitable for massive modern disks (terabytes), unless cluster sizes are large. Performance can degrade with many small files.

5. **Block Layer vs. Clusters**  
   - **Block layer** in the OS kernel abstracts LBAs and issues read/write operations at the OS’s chosen block size.  
   - **FAT32** logic sits above this, deciding which clusters map to which LBAs.
