Below is a **continuation** of the demo-oriented notes on **file storage management** in Linux. We’ll go deeper into **GPT partitioning** using the **`parted`** tool, briefly look at **LVM** (Logical Volume Manager) concepts, and include additional examples and diagrams to illustrate more advanced scenarios. Feel free to integrate this into your existing Obsidian notes.
## 1. Beyond `fdisk`: Using `parted` and GPT

### 1.1 Why `parted`?
- **`fdisk`** is excellent for **MBR** (Master Boot Record) style partitioning but can be limited with newer **GPT** (GUID Partition Table) disks, especially those larger than 2 TB.
- **`parted`** can handle both **MBR** and **GPT**, offering more flexibility (e.g., resizing partitions without reboot, advanced alignment options).
### 1.2 Quick GPT Refresher
- GPT is a modern partition table format:
  - Stores multiple copies of the partition table for redundancy.
  - Each partition gets a **globally unique ID** (GUID).
  - No limit of 4 “primary” partitions (as in MBR); you can have many more partitions.
---
## 2. Working with `parted`
### 2.1 Starting `parted`
```bash
sudo parted /dev/sdb
```
**Common parted commands**:
- `print` → Display current partition table and GPT/MBR info.
- `mklabel gpt` → Initialize a disk with a GPT label.
- `mkpart` → Create a new partition, specifying size.
- `rm` → Remove a partition.
- `quit` → Exit parted (changes are saved immediately, unlike `fdisk` which uses `w` or `q`).
### 2.2 Example: Creating a GPT Disk + Partitions
1. **Select the disk**:
   ```bash
   sudo parted /dev/sdb
   ```
2. **Create a GPT label** (warning: erases all data):
   ```bash
   (parted) mklabel gpt
   ```
3. **Create a new partition** (e.g., 10GB):
   ```bash
   (parted) mkpart primary ext4 1MiB 10GiB
   ```
   - **Start** at `1MiB` to ensure alignment.
   - **End** at `10GiB`.
   - The partition is designated “ext4,” but parted doesn’t actually format it; it’s just a label hint.
4. **Print** to confirm:
   ```bash
   (parted) print
   ```
5. **Quit** parted:
   ```bash
   (parted) quit
   ```
### 2.3 Verifying
```bash
sudo lsblk -o NAME,SIZE,TYPE,FSTYPE,PARTTYPE
```
You should see:
```
sdb       50G  disk
└─sdb1    10G  part
```
Where `sdb1` is recognized as a GPT partition.

## 3. Formatting GPT Partitions

Partition creation with `parted` just sets up the layout. We still need to **format** if we want a file system:

```bash
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1
```
(or `mkfs.xfs`, `mkfs.vfat`, etc. as desired).

---

## 4. Logical Volume Manager (LVM) Basics

### 4.1 Why LVM?
- **LVM** provides an abstraction layer on top of physical partitions or disks:
  - Combine multiple partitions (or entire disks) into a single “Volume Group” (VG).
  - Create “Logical Volumes” (LVs) on that group, which can be **resized** or **snapshotted** more flexibly.
- Common workflow:  
  **Physical Volumes (PVs)** → **Volume Groups (VGs)** → **Logical Volumes (LVs)** → format each LV with a file system.

### 4.2 Basic LVM Workflow Example

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Physical Disks/Partitions<br>/dev/sdb1, /dev/sdc1...] --> B[Physical Volume (PV)]
    B --> C[Volume Group (VG)]
    C --> D[Logical Volumes (LV)]
    D --> E[File System ext4/xfs on each LV]
```

1. **Create PV**:
   ```bash
   sudo pvcreate /dev/sdb1
   ```
2. **Create a Volume Group**:
   ```bash
   sudo vgcreate MyDataVG /dev/sdb1
   ```
3. **Create a Logical Volume** (e.g., 5GB):
   ```bash
   sudo lvcreate -n MyDataLV -L 5G MyDataVG
   ```
4. **Format** the LV:
   ```bash
   sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/MyDataVG/MyDataLV
   ```
5. **Mount** the LV:
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir /mnt/mydata
   sudo mount /dev/MyDataVG/MyDataLV /mnt/mydata
   ```

**Now** you can store files in `/mnt/mydata`. If you need more space:
```bash
sudo lvextend -L +2G /dev/MyDataVG/MyDataLV
sudo resize2fs /dev/MyDataVG/MyDataLV
```
*(XFS filesystems typically use `xfs_growfs` to expand.)*

## 5. Aligning Partitions (Recap)

### 5.1 Why Alignment Matters
As mentioned before, starting partitions on boundaries that match the device’s physical sector (e.g., multiples of **1MiB** or 2048 sectors) can significantly improve performance and reduce write amplification, especially on SSDs.

**`parted`** defaults to MiB alignment on GPT disks if not told otherwise, which is typically best practice.

---

## 6. Demo: Combining `parted` + LVM

A real example might look like:

1. **Identify Free Disk**: `/dev/sdc` (100GB).
2. **Initialize GPT**:
   ```bash
   sudo parted /dev/sdc mklabel gpt
   ```
3. **Create a partition** spanning the entire disk:
   ```bash
   sudo parted -a optimal /dev/sdc mkpart primary 1MiB 100%
   ```
4. **Mark** that partition as LVM:
   ```bash
   (parted) set 1 lvm on
   ```
5. **Create LVM on /dev/sdc1**:
   ```bash
   sudo pvcreate /dev/sdc1
   sudo vgcreate DemoVG /dev/sdc1
   sudo lvcreate -n DemoLV -L 50G DemoVG
   ```
6. **Format** and **mount**:
   ```bash
   sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/DemoVG/DemoLV
   sudo mkdir /mnt/demo
   sudo mount /dev/DemoVG/DemoLV /mnt/demo
   ```
7. **Check**:
   ```bash
   df -h /mnt/demo
   ```
   Should show 50G available. If you later want 10 more GB:
   ```bash
   sudo lvextend -L +10G /dev/DemoVG/DemoLV
   sudo resize2fs /dev/DemoVG/DemoLV
   ```

## 7. Visual Summary

Here’s a more advanced **Mermaid** diagram integrating GPT partitioning and LVM:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    A[Physical Disk<br>/dev/sdc (100GB)] --> B[parted<br>(GPT label)]
    B --> C[/dev/sdc1<br>(LVM partition)]
    C --> D[Physical Volume (pvcreate)]
    D --> E[Volume Group: DemoVG (vgcreate)]
    E --> F[Logical Volume: DemoLV (lvcreate 50GB)]
    F --> G[mkfs.ext4 /dev/DemoVG/DemoLV]
    G --> H[mount /dev/DemoVG/DemoLV /mnt/demo]
```

1. **GPT** partitioning with **parted**.
2. **Physical Volume** created on `/dev/sdc1`.
3. **Volume Group** aggregates PVs.
4. **Logical Volume** carved out from VG.
5. **File System** formatted on the LV.
6. **Mount** the final LV to a directory.

## 8. Practical Considerations

1. **Backups**: Although LVM is powerful, always maintain **external backups**. LVM is not a replacement for backups or RAID.  
2. **Snapshottable**: LVM allows creating **snapshots** (read-only or read-write), handy for backups or data integrity testing.  
3. **Thin Provisioning**: Advanced LVM can allocate space on demand, but it’s more complex (requires `lvcreate --thinpool`).  
4. **Performance**: Overhead is minimal, but alignment and proper setup are critical to avoid fragmentation.  
5. **UEFI vs. Legacy Boot**: If this disk is to be bootable, you need a small **EFI System Partition** (ESP) formatted as FAT32 for UEFI systems.
