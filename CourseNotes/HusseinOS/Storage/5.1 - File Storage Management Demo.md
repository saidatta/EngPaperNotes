Below is a set of **Obsidian**-formatted notes titled “OS: File Storage Management Demo.” These notes walk through a hands-on demonstration of partitioning, formatting, and mounting various file systems (ext4, FAT, NTFS) in Linux. They include **commands**, **explanations**, and **visual illustrations** (Mermaid diagrams) to show how partitions and mounts work under the hood. Feel free to copy/paste into your Obsidian vault or another Markdown editor.

This demo illustrates how to:
1. **List disks** and partitions (`lsblk`, `fdisk`, `parted`).
2. **Create** and **delete** partitions using `fdisk`.
3. **Format** partitions with different file systems (ext4, NTFS, FAT32).
4. **Mount** and **unmount** those partitions.
5. Understand how copying files between different partitions/file systems works.

> **Warning**: Partitioning and formatting can destroy data. Only do this on a **test machine** or VM you don’t mind wiping. Don’t try these commands on a production or important system.

## 1. Environment Setup & Tools

### 1.1 Commands Overview
- **`lsblk`**: Lists all block devices (disks, partitions, loop devices).
- **`fdisk`**: Interactive tool for partitioning (creating, deleting, listing partitions).
- **`mkfs.xxx`**: Used to format partitions with a given file system, e.g. `mkfs.ext4`, `mkfs.vfat`, etc.
- **`mount`** / **`umount`**: Mounts or unmounts a file system to/from a directory.
- **`mkdir`**: Creates a directory, often used to create “mount points.”

### 1.2 Checking Disks with `lsblk`
```bash
lsblk
```
Output (example):
```
NAME        MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda           8:0    0 931.5G  0 disk
├─sda1        8:1    0   500M  0 part /boot/efi
├─sda2        8:2    0   100G  0 part /ZFS_root
├─sda3        8:3    0   50G   0 part /btrfs_root
└─sda4        8:4    0 781.5G  0 part /
sdb           8:16   1  14.3G  0 disk
└─sdb1        8:17   1  14.3G  0 part /media/usbdrive
```
- **`sda`** is the primary disk (931.5GB).
- **`sdb`** is a USB flash drive (14.3GB).
- The `RM` column (`1` or `0`) indicates if the device is **removable**.
- Mountpoints show where each partition is “attached” in the file system tree.

## 2. Partition Creation and Deletion (using `fdisk`)

### 2.1 Entering `fdisk`
To partition the USB disk `/dev/sdb`, for example:
```bash
sudo fdisk /dev/sdb
```
You enter an **interactive** mode:
```
Command (m for help): m
```
Pressing `m` shows a list of possible commands:
- **`p`**: print the partition table
- **`n`**: add new partition
- **`d`**: delete a partition
- **`w`**: write changes and exit
- **`q`**: quit without saving changes
- And so on.

### 2.2 Deleting an Existing Partition
```bash
Command (m for help): p   # shows current partitions
   ...
Command (m for help): d   # delete a partition
Partition number (1,2,...): 1
```
- This removes partition #1 (assuming `sdb1` is the only partition).

### 2.3 Creating a New Partition
```bash
Command (m for help): n
Partition type:
   p   primary
   e   extended
Select (default p): p

Partition number (1-4, default 1): 1
First sector (2048-..., default 2048): 2048
Last sector, +sectors or +size{K,M,G,T,P} (... default ...): +5G
```
- This creates a **primary** partition of size **5GB** starting at sector 2048 (commonly aligned).
- We can create multiple such partitions (e.g., `+5G` for each).

### 2.4 Writing Changes
After adding partitions, type:
```bash
Command (m for help): w
```
- **Writes** the partition table to disk and exits `fdisk`.

### 2.5 Verifying Partitions
Outside `fdisk`, run:
```bash
lsblk
```
Now you’ll see `/dev/sdb1`, `/dev/sdb2`, etc., each with **5GB** (or whatever sizes you chose).

---

## 3. Formatting Partitions (`mkfs`)

A partition is **raw** until you place a file system on it. Below are examples of common file systems:

### 3.1 ext4
```bash
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1
```
- Creates an **ext4** file system on partition `sdb1`.
- You’ll see output about **inodes**, **journals**, etc.

### 3.2 FAT32 (VFat)
```bash
sudo mkfs.vfat -F 32 /dev/sdb2
```
- Creates a **FAT32** file system, widely compatible with many devices.
- `-F 32` specifies **32-bit** FAT.

### 3.3 NTFS
```bash
sudo mkfs.ntfs -f /dev/sdb3
```
- Formats partition `sdb3` as **NTFS** (commonly used in Windows).
- The `-f` or `-Q` (quick format) can vary depending on the `mkfs.ntfs` version.

*(Ensure you have the necessary tools installed, e.g., `ntfs-3g` for NTFS support on Linux.)*

---

## 4. Mounting Partitions

### 4.1 Mount Points
A **mount point** is simply an **empty directory**. Once you mount a partition there, it appears as if that directory holds the partition’s contents.

```bash
# Create a mount point directory
sudo mkdir /mnt/flashdrive1

# Mount ext4 partition /dev/sdb1
sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/flashdrive1
```
Now, any files you place in `/mnt/flashdrive1` actually reside on the **ext4** file system located at `/dev/sdb1`.

### 4.2 Verifying
```bash
mount | grep sdb1
```
or
```bash
df -h | grep sdb1
```
You should see `/dev/sdb1` mounted on `/mnt/flashdrive1` with the ext4 file system.

### 4.3 Auto-Mount or Manual?
- By default, removable drives may not auto-mount in Linux. 
- Tools like `udisks2` or desktop environments (GNOME, KDE) often auto-mount USB drives to `/media/<username>/something`.
- You can manually unmount:
  ```bash
  sudo umount /mnt/flashdrive1
  ```

---

## 5. Example: Copying Files Between Partitions

When you **copy** a file from one partition to another, especially if they’re **different file systems**, a lot happens:

1. **Read** from the source partition (translation through that file system).
2. **Write** to the destination partition with the destination file system’s rules (different metadata, possibly different block size).
3. File name, attributes, or special characters might behave differently between file systems.

### 5.1 Simple Copy Demo
```bash
# Suppose /dev/sdb1 is mounted at /mnt/flashdrive1 (ext4)
# and /dev/sdb2 is mounted at /mnt/flashdrive2 (FAT32)

cd /mnt/flashdrive1
sudo touch example.txt
echo "Hello from ext4" | sudo tee example.txt

# Copy example.txt to the FAT32 partition
sudo cp example.txt /mnt/flashdrive2/
```
- The kernel performs two sets of I/Os: read `example.txt` from `/mnt/flashdrive1` (ext4), then write it into `/mnt/flashdrive2` (FAT32).

## 6. Visual Overview

Below is a **Mermaid** diagram illustrating the partitioning and mounting workflow:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Physical Disk<br>/dev/sdb] --> B[fdisk /dev/sdb<br>Create Partitions]
    B --> C[/dev/sdb1<br>(ext4)]
    B --> D[/dev/sdb2<br>(FAT32)]
    B --> E[/dev/sdb3<br>(NTFS)]
    C --> F[mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/ext4drive]
    D --> G[mount /dev/sdb2 /mnt/fatdrive]
    E --> H[mount /dev/sdb3 /mnt/ntfsdrive]
    
    subgraph Usage
    F --> I[Read/Write Files in /mnt/ext4drive]
    G --> J[Read/Write Files in /mnt/fatdrive]
    H --> K[Read/Write Files in /mnt/ntfsdrive]
    end
```

1. **Create partitions** on `/dev/sdb` via `fdisk`.
2. **Format** them with different file systems (`ext4`, `vfat`, `ntfs`).
3. **Mount** them at different folders in `/mnt/...`.
4. Now you can **access** each partition as a normal directory.

## 7. Common Pitfalls

1. **Accidental Overwriting**: Using `fdisk` or `mkfs` on the wrong disk or partition can wipe data. 
2. **Mount Confusion**: Forgetting to unmount a partition before removing a USB drive can lead to data corruption or leftover mount entries.
3. **Permissions**: If your new mount is owned by `root`, you may need `sudo` to create/edit files. You can use `chown` or mount options (e.g. `umask`, `uid`, `gid` for FAT/NTFS) to allow normal users.
4. **Partition Alignment**: On SSDs especially, you want partition starts to be aligned (e.g., multiple of 2048 sectors) for best performance.
5. **File System Limits**: FAT32 has max file size of ~4GB. NTFS or exFAT might be needed for larger files.

## 8. Final Thoughts

- This demonstration scratches the surface of **storage management** in Linux.
- **fdisk** is basic but widely used. Tools like **`parted`** can handle more advanced GPT partitioning and large disks.
- Linux supports a huge variety of file systems (ext2/3/4, XFS, btrfs, ZFS, NTFS, exFAT, etc.).
- Understanding partitioning, formatting, and mounting is crucial for:
  - Multi-boot systems,
  - External storage (USB, SSDs, etc.),
  - Data organization, backups, and performance tuning.

**Next Steps**: Explore advanced file systems (ZFS, btrfs) or investigate LVM (Logical Volume Manager) for flexible partition resizing, snapshots, and more.
