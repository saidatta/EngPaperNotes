Below is a **very detailed** set of **Obsidian**-formatted notes for a **PhD-level engineer** on **“OS: Compilers and Linkers”**, extending into **JIT compilation**, **interpretation**, **garbage collection**, and **runtime trade-offs**. These notes integrate code snippets, conceptual explanations, diagrams, and tables to provide a comprehensive view.

In the previous notes, we covered **ahead-of-time (AOT)** compilation, linking object files, and how an OS loads executables. Now, we’ll delve into **just-in-time (JIT) compilation**, **interpreted vs. compiled** languages, and **garbage collection**—key considerations for modern runtimes like Java, JavaScript V8, and more.

## 1. Recap: Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compilation

**AOT** compilation transforms source code into **machine code** **before** execution:

1. **Source Code** (e.g., `.c`, `.cpp`)  
2. **Compiler** → **Object Files**  
3. **Linker** → **Executable**  
4. **OS Loader** → **Process Execution**

Once compiled, your program’s instructions sit in **read-only** text segments. This is **fast** at runtime because the CPU directly executes instructions. However, you must **recompile** when targeting different platforms (architectures, OS ABIs, etc.).

## 2. Interpreted Languages

### 2.1 Interpretive Overhead
In **interpreted** languages (e.g., classic Python, Ruby), the runtime reads **source code** at execution time. It often:
1. **Parses** code into an internal AST (Abstract Syntax Tree).
2. **Walks** the AST or bytecode each time you run a function, deciding how to handle each statement/operation.

This imposes a **per-statement overhead**: the interpreter must “figure out” *what* to do *every time*, requiring extra CPU cycles.

**Consequences**:
- Generally slower than AOT-compiled languages (C, C++) because each operation has an extra interpretive step.
- Memory overhead for the runtime structures (AST, bytecode, etc.).

## 3. Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation

### 3.1 The Concept
**JIT** compilers bridge the gap between **interpreted** and **AOT** compiled languages:

1. The runtime initially interprets code or runs bytecode instructions.
2. It detects **hot paths** or **frequently used** code sections.
3. It **dynamically** compiles those sections into **native machine code** at runtime.
4. That native code is placed in **executable** memory (often the heap region marked as executable).
5. The program’s instruction pointer can jump to that newly compiled region, executing at near native speed.

**Trade-Off**:
- **Extra overhead** at runtime to compile code sections.  
- **Faster** subsequent executions if those sections are “hot.”

### 3.2 Example: Java’s HotSpot VM
- Java bytecode is **interpreted** until a function is called repeatedly.  
- **HotSpot** JIT identifies these hot functions, compiles them into machine code, stores them in a specialized memory area, and replaces the interpreter loop with direct calls to the compiled code.

### 3.3 Example: JavaScript V8
- Chrome’s V8 engine interprets JavaScript or uses a baseline compiler for quick startup.  
- “Turbofan” pipeline can optimize repeated function calls, inlining or specializing them.  
- If the code’s behavior changes shape (e.g., arguments differ), it can **deoptimize** back to an interpreter or baseline.

## 4. Garbage Collection and Runtimes

### 4.1 GC Basics
Garbage-collected languages (Java, Go, Python, JavaScript, etc.) rely on **runtimes** that automatically manage memory:

1. **Allocation**: The runtime allocates objects on the heap.
2. **Reachability**: The runtime tracks live objects via references.
3. **Periodic collection**: A GC pass scans or marks unused objects, then reclaims them.
4. This process often involves **pausing** or partially pausing user code to ensure correct object references.

### 4.2 Runtime Overhead
1. **GC Pauses**: The collector may stop the world to safely mark and sweep memory, causing latency spikes.
2. **Metadata**: Each object typically has extra metadata (type info, reference counters, etc.), increasing memory footprint.
3. **Thread Synchronization**: If multiple threads share the same heap, the GC needs concurrency control (mutexes, locks).

#### Example: Linkerd Proxy Rewrite
- **Linkerd** v1 used Java (JVM) → occasional stalls during GC.  
- For low-latency proxies, these GC pauses introduced unacceptable delays.  
- They **rewrote** their data plane in **Rust**, avoiding GC overhead.  
- Achieved better real-time performance (at the cost of manual or ownership-based memory management).

## 5. Comparing Language Execution Models

| **Model**       | **Examples**           | **Runtime Overhead** | **Performance**               | **Memory Management**                              |
|-----------------|------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **AOT**         | C, C++, Rust          | Compile-time only    | High speed at runtime         | Manual or ownership-based (C++, Rust), no GC       |
| **Interpreted** | Python (classic), Ruby| Large interpret cost | Usually slower                | Typically GC or refcount, overhead from parsing    |
| **JIT**         | Java, JS (V8), .NET   | Dynamic compilation  | Can approach AOT performance  | GC overhead, but faster than pure interpretation   |
| **Hybrid**      | PyPy (Python w/ JIT)  | Partial JIT / fallback| Improves hot paths           | GC + JIT, can be complex to implement effectively  |

## 6. Role of Compilers and Linkers in JIT Context

### 6.1 Traditional AOT Linker
- Merges object files **before** runtime.  
- Produces a single executable or library that the OS loader can load.

### 6.2 JIT “Linking” on the Fly
- The JIT runtime effectively **generates** machine code and “links” it **into memory** (heap region).  
- The memory must be marked **executable** (e.g., using `mprotect` on Unix) to allow the CPU to run instructions there.  
- This approach bypasses normal OS-level linking but still must handle symbol resolution internally (for advanced JITs referencing runtime library symbols).

### 6.3 Security Implications
- Marking heap pages **executable** can open avenues for exploits if an attacker can inject code into that memory region.
- Runtimes mitigate this with **sandboxing**, **W^X** (write XOR execute) policies, or specialized JIT compartments.

## 7. Summary & Key Takeaways

1. **Interpreted** languages incur an **interpretation overhead** each run.  
2. **JIT** compilation transforms hot code segments to **native machine code** at runtime, bridging the performance gap.  
3. **Garbage collection** introduces periodic pauses and memory overhead; can be unacceptable for certain real-time or low-latency demands.  
4. **Security**: JITs require marking memory executable, which must be done carefully to prevent code injection vulnerabilities.  
5. **Ahead-of-Time** vs. **JIT** vs. **Interpretation**: Each trade-off suits different use cases, from minimal-latency microservices to flexible scripting environments.

```

1. **Baseline Compile** quickly produces low-quality code or bytecode for **fast startup**.  
2. **Runtime profiling** identifies hot functions, types used, etc.  
3. **Optimizing JIT** compiles them to high-quality machine code, stored in an **executable** region of memory.  
4. If assumptions break (like type changes), it **de-optimizes** back to baseline.
