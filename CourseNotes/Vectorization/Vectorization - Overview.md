Now, let's break down the process of vectorization:

1. **Vectorization**: This is the process of transforming a computation from operating on a single value at a time to operating on a set of values (vector) at once. Modern CPUs provide direct support for vector operations with instructions that can, for example, add together two arrays of numbers element-wise.

2. **Hardware Perspective**: Modern CPUs have special hardware to support vector operations. This hardware includes special registers and functional units that can perform operations on vectors of data in parallel.

3. **Compiler Perspective**: Compilers play a crucial role in vectorization. They analyze the code and transform parts of it that can be executed as vector operations. However, compilers are not perfect and may not be able to vectorize all parts of the code that could theoretically be vectorized.

4. **User Perspective**: As a programmer, you can help the compiler to vectorize your code by writing it in a way that makes the parallelism explicit. This often involves structuring your data in arrays and writing your loops in a way that the iterations are independent and can be executed in any order.

Here's a simple example of vectorization in C++ using the Eigen library:

```cpp
#include <Eigen/Dense>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    Eigen::ArrayXf v(3);
    Eigen::ArrayXf w(3);
    v << 1, 2, 3;
    w << 4, 5, 6;
    std::cout << "v + w =\n" << v + w << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `v` and `w` are vectors of floating-point numbers. The expression `v + w` adds together the vectors element-wise. This operation is vectorized, meaning that it can be executed in parallel on a CPU that supports vector operations.

Remember, vectorization is a powerful tool for improving the performance of your code, but it's not always applicable. The effectiveness of vectorization depends on the specific characteristics of your computation and your hardware.
