### 1.1 Historical Context and Problem Phrasing
- Introduce machine learning (ML) as a function approximation and in a probabilistic context
- ML characterized as nonlinear regression in high-dimensional spaces
- Discuss how deep learning and Bayesian networks fit in the larger scheme of ML

### 1.2 Emergence of Machine Learning
- Rapid development and importance of ML in various industries
- Focus on basic ideas behind ML and building probabilistic models

### 1.3 Basic Components of Machine Learning
- Importance of data, various types of measurements (e.g., light intensity, EEG, stock-market data)
- Learning requires a teacher providing information for predictions
- Labels as a form of data, used for optical object recognition

### 1.4 Types of Machine Learning
- Supervised Learning: Learning with an objective function and labels provided by a teacher
- Unsupervised Learning: Learning without labels, teacher provides guidance through objectives (e.g., clustering)
- Reinforcement Learning: Teacher provides guidance, learner explores possible actions for novel solutions
- Supervised learning as the primary focus for fundamentals of learning theory and model building

### 1.5 Basic Idea of Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning
- Solving problems with computers without explicitly programming them
- Programming general learning machines instead of specific solutions
- Advantages for tasks that are difficult to program explicitly

### 1.6 Illustration of a Letter-Recognition Task
- Example: character recognition (e.g., translating the letter 'A' into its ASCII string)
- Challenges due to variations in shapes and styles of characters
- ML approaches for handling complex tasks like character recognition

### Examples 
**Supervised Learning:**

1. Spam Detection: Email services use supervised learning to detect whether an incoming email is spam or not based on labeled data of spam and non-spam emails.

2. Image Recognition: Image recognition applications, such as those used in self-driving cars, use supervised learning to classify and label objects in images.

**Unsupervised Learning:**

1. Clustering: Unsupervised learning is commonly used for clustering similar data points together, such as grouping customers based on their buying behavior.

2. Anomaly Detection: Unsupervised learning can also be used to detect unusual patterns or outliers in large datasets, such as identifying fraudulent transactions in financial data.

**Reinforcement Learning:**

1. Game AI: Reinforcement learning is used in game AI, where the agent (game player) learns from its experiences and adapts its strategy to maximize the reward (winning the game).

2. Robotics: Reinforcement learning is also used in robotics to train agents to perform tasks in uncertain environments, such as navigating a robot through a cluttered space.
