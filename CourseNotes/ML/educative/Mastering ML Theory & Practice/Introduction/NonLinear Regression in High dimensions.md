## Linear Regression

Linear regression is a simple supervised machine learning method that assumes a linear model, which can be represented by the equation:

`y = w0 + w1 * x`

This low-dimensional example has a single feature (x) and a scalar label (y). The goal is to determine the offset parameter (w0) and the slope parameter (w1) that minimize the summed squared difference between the regressed values and the data points.

## Nonlinear Regression

Modern machine learning often deals with high-dimensional data and nonlinear functions. However, using nonlinear functions can lead to overfitting when the model complexity is increased arbitrarily.

### Overfitting and Bias-Variance Trade-off

Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and fits noise in the data, resulting in poor generalization to new data points. The bias-variance trade-off aims to find the right balance between underfitting and overfitting. Regularization techniques help to make the data more regular with respect to the model, thus preventing overfitting.

### Building Nonlinear Models

There are infinite choices for nonlinear functions. One option is to use a polynomial of order n:

`y = w0 + w1 * x + w2 * x^2 + ... + wn * x^n`

For multiple feature values, the function may depend on a combination of the features:

`y = w0 + w1 * x1 + w2 * x2 + w3 * x1 * x2 + w4 * x1^2 * x2 + ...`

Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are another popular choice for building nonlinear models. Each node in an ANN represents a basic operation of summing weighted inputs and applying a nonlinear transfer function to the net input.

## Artificial Neural Networks

An artificial neuron weights each input with an adjustable parameter, sums the weighted inputs, and applies a nonlinear function (e.g., tanh) to the summed input:

`yj = tanh(sum(wji * xi))`

These networks can have many layers of neurons, with deep learning focusing on networks with many layers (known as deep neural networks). Preventing overfitting is essential in deep learning.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a specific type of deep neural network commonly used. Preventing overfitting in deep learning involves techniques such as dropout and regularization.

Understanding the theoretical foundations of machine learning methods is necessary to evaluate the predictions and ensure the appropriate application of these techniques.
