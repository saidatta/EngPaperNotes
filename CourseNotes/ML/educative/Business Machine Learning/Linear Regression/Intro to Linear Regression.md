## Introduction to Linear Regression

-   Linear regression is a statistical method used to analyze the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
-   It is considered the "workhorse" approach for supervised machine learning and is a practical and widely used statistical or machine learning model.
-   Linear regression serves as a good jumping-off point for newer approaches.
-   The earliest form of regression was the least squares method, published by Legendre in 1805 and later published by Gauss in 1809.
- The term "regression" was coined by Sir Francis Galton in his work published in 1875 while he was describing the biological phenomenon of relating the heights of descendants to their tall ancestors.
- Sir Galton discovered that a man's son tends to be roughly as tall as his father, but the son's height tends to be closer (regress or drift toward) to the overall average height.
-   Linear regression models assume a linear relationship between the dependent variable and independent variables, with the errors or residuals following a normal distribution.
-   Linear regression models can be represented by an equation: y = β0 + β1x1 + β2x2 + ... + βnxn + ε, where y is the dependent variable, x1, x2, ..., xn are the independent variables, β0, β1, β2, ..., βn are the regression coefficients or weights, and ε is the error term.
-  Linear regression can be used to predict future values of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables, identify the most important independent variables that affect the dependent variable, and test the significance of the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables.
-   Linear regression can be performed using various software tools and programming languages, such as Excel, R, Python, and SAS.

## Simple Linear Regression vs. Multiple Linear Regression

-   If we use a single feature to predict the target, it's simple linear regression.
-   If we use two or more features to predict the target, it's multiple linear regression. The coefficients or weights are used in both cases, and we have a single target.
-   In linear regression, the target must be on a continuous scale, while the feature(s) can be categorical or continuous.
-   Correlation measures the extent to which a linear relationship exists between two variables, while linear regression distinguishes between the target and features and predicts the targets for given features.
-   The feature(s) are represented by X in machine learning, while the target or dependent variable is represented by y in machine learning.

## Bias and Variance

-   The bias-variance trade-off is one of the fundamental concepts in model performance in machine learning.
-   Bias is an error from erroneous assumptions in the learning algorithm that causes the algorithm to miss the relevant relations between features and target outputs.
-   Variance is an error from sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training set that causes the algorithm to model the random noise in the training data rather than the intended outputs.
-   The optimal point for any model is the level of complexity at which the increase in bias is equivalent to the reduction in variance.
-   If the model complexity exceeds this optimal point, we are overfitting our model, while if the complexity falls short of the optimal point, we are underfitting the model.
-   Dealing with bias and variance is about overfitting and underfitting, with bias reduced, and variance increased in relation to model complexity.
-   The selection of an accurate error measure is key to this process.

Overall, linear regression is a powerful and practical technique for supervised machine learning, and understanding the concepts of bias and variance is essential for model performance
