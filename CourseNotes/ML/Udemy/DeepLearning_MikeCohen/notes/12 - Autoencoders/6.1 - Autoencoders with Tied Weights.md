## 1. Introduction and Key Concepts

1. **Recall: Standard Autoencoder Setup**  
   - An autoencoder typically has:
     \[
     \text{Input} \rightarrow \text{(Encoder Layers)} \rightarrow 
     \text{(Latent Layer)} \rightarrow \text{(Decoder Layers)} \rightarrow 
     \text{Output (same shape as input)}
     \]
   - Normally, **encoder** and **decoder** weights are \textit{independent}.

2. **Tied Weights**  
   - **Definition**: For a given layer on the encoder side, its weights are “transposed and reused” on the corresponding decoder side.  
   - Equivalently, we eliminate a separate decoder weight matrix and directly reuse (transpose) the encoder weight matrix during the forward pass.  
   - **Contrast to “frozen weights”**:
     - Frozen weights: The weights do **not** change during training (learning rate is effectively 0).  
     - Tied weights: They **do** change during training, but **encoder’s layer** and **decoder’s layer** share the same parameters (in a transposed manner).

3. **Why Tied Weights?**  
   - **Parameter Efficiency**: Fewer learnable parameters → potentially less overfitting.  
   - **Symmetry**: Conceptually enforces a mirror-like structure between encoder and decoder.

4. **Caveat**  
   - This approach might produce **slightly lower performance** or need more training to achieve comparable results to a full (non-tied) autoencoder.  
   - More **tedious** to implement because one must manually handle transposes and specify matrix multiplications.

## 2. Preliminary: `nn.Parameter` vs. `nn.Linear`

1. **`nn.Parameter`**  
   - Represents a tensor whose values \textit{will} be updated via backprop.  
   - Generally stored internally by modules like `nn.Linear`. We can also create them manually:
     ```python
     W_enc = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(out_features, in_features))
     ```
   - **Shape**: Typically \(\text{(out_features, in_features)}\).

2. **`nn.Linear(in_features, out_features)`**  
   - Automatically creates an internal `weight` parameter shaped \((\text{out\_features}, \text{in\_features})\).  
   - Also creates a `bias` vector of size \(\text{out\_features}\).  
   - Provides a forward pass `linear(x) = x @ weight^T + bias` under the hood.

3. **Shape Confusions**  
   - `nn.Parameter` often used in a shape \((\text{out}, \text{in})\).  
   - `nn.Linear` is specified as `nn.Linear(in_features, out_features)` but internally creates `weight` of size `(out_features, in_features)`.

## 3. Implementation in PyTorch

### 3.1 Dataset Setup

```yaml
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Suppose we load MNIST data (or a subset: 20k samples)
# X_mnist: shape (N, 28, 28)
# We'll flatten to 784 for each image.

N = 20000
X = X_mnist[:N].reshape(N, 784).astype(np.float32) / 255.0
X_tensor = torch.tensor(X)
```
```

### 3.2 Defining a Tied-Weight Autoencoder Class

```yaml
```python
class TiedWeightAE(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(TiedWeightAE, self).__init__()
        
        # 1) Input layer uses a typical nn.Linear
        #    784 -> 128
        self.input_layer = nn.Linear(784, 128)
        
        # 2) Tied weight: encoder
        #    We'll define a matrix that goes from 128 -> 50
        #    using nn.Parameter (size: 50 x 128)
        self.enc = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(50, 128)*0.01, requires_grad=True)
        
        # 3) Output layer (final decoding stage)
        #    128 -> 784 (like a normal layer)
        self.output_layer = nn.Linear(128, 784)
        
        # Activation
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.sigmoid = nn.Sigmoid()
        
    def forward(self, x):
        # x shape: (batch_size, 784)
        
        # Encoder part 1: standard layer
        x_enc = self.relu(self.input_layer(x))  # shape (batch_size, 128)
        
        # Encoder part 2: multiply by self.enc
        #   self.enc is shape (50, 128).
        #   PyTorch linear layer does x @ W^T + b,
        #   so we must do x_enc @ enc.T to match dims:
        x_latent = self.relu(torch.matmul(x_enc, self.enc.t()))
        
        # Decoder part 1: reuse the same enc as transposed
        #   shape of x_latent is (batch_size, 50)
        #   shape of self.enc: (50, 128)
        #   So decode = x_latent @ self.enc
        #   to get shape (batch_size, 128)
        x_dec = self.relu(torch.matmul(x_latent, self.enc))
        
        # Decoder part 2: final layer back to 784
        x_out = self.sigmoid(self.output_layer(x_dec))  # (batch_size, 784)
        
        return x_out
```
```

**Explanation**:
- `self.enc` is **one** weight matrix. In a standard autoencoder, we might have:
  - An `nn.Linear(128, 50)` and an `nn.Linear(50, 128)`.  
  - Here, we remove the second linear layer and do a manual matrix multiply with the transpose of the same matrix.  
- The **bias** for the “middle layers” is absent or can be included if desired (we might define a separate `nn.Parameter` for bias).

## 4. Checking Model Integrity

```yaml
```python
# Quick sanity check
model_test = TiedWeightAE()
test_input = X_tensor[:5]  # shape (5, 784)
with torch.no_grad():
    test_output = model_test(test_input)
    
print("Input shape:", test_input.shape)
print("Output shape:", test_output.shape)
# Expect both to be (5, 784)
```
```

---

## 5. Training the Tied-Weight Autoencoder

### 5.1 Training Loop

```yaml
```python
def train_tied_ae(X, epochs=10, batch_size=32, lr=0.001):
    model = TiedWeightAE()
    optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=lr)
    criterion = nn.MSELoss()
    
    N = X.shape[0]
    
    for ep in range(epochs):
        total_loss = 0.0
        # Simple random mini-batch approach
        for _ in range(200):  # e.g., 200 batches per epoch
            idx = np.random.choice(N, batch_size, replace=False)
            x_batch = X[idx]
            
            x_out = model(x_batch)
            loss = criterion(x_out, x_batch)
            
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
            
            total_loss += loss.item()
        
        avg_loss = total_loss / 200
        print(f"Epoch {ep+1}/{epochs}, Loss={avg_loss:.4f}")
    
    return model
```
```

**Notes**:
- This approach doesn’t systematically cover the entire dataset each epoch, but is fine for illustration.
- **Parameter Counting**: Now, one matrix (`enc`) is used for both encoder and decoder, thus fewer parameters than a standard two-layer solution.

### 5.2 Execute Training

```yaml
```python
model = train_tied_ae(X_tensor, epochs=10, batch_size=32, lr=0.001)
```
```

**Observe**: The loss typically goes down, though perhaps not quite as fast or as low as a non-tied network (depending on data coverage and hyperparameters).

## 6. Visualizing Reconstructions and Noise Removal

### 6.1 Reconstruction from Clean Inputs

```yaml
```python
n_test = 5
test_data = X_tensor[:n_test]
with torch.no_grad():
    rec_data = model(test_data)

# Plot original vs. reconstructed
fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, n_test, figsize=(2*n_test, 4))
for i in range(n_test):
    # original
    axs[0, i].imshow(test_data[i].reshape(28,28), cmap='gray')
    axs[0, i].axis('off')
    axs[0, i].set_title("Original")
    
    # reconstructed
    axs[1, i].imshow(rec_data[i].reshape(28,28), cmap='gray')
    axs[1, i].axis('off')
    axs[1, i].set_title("Reconstructed")

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
```

- Expect results similar to a normal autoencoder: the digits are recognizable, though potentially blurrier.

### 6.2 Noise Removal Example

```yaml
```python
noise_factor = 0.25
test_data_noisy = test_data + noise_factor * torch.rand_like(test_data)
test_data_noisy = torch.clamp(test_data_noisy, 0., 1.)

with torch.no_grad():
    rec_noisy = model(test_data_noisy)

# Plot
fig, axs = plt.subplots(3, n_test, figsize=(2*n_test, 6))
for i in range(n_test):
    # original
    axs[0, i].imshow(test_data[i].reshape(28,28), cmap='gray')
    axs[0, i].axis('off')
    axs[0, i].set_title("Original")
    
    # noisy
    axs[1, i].imshow(test_data_noisy[i].reshape(28,28), cmap='gray')
    axs[1, i].axis('off')
    axs[1, i].set_title("Noisy")
    
    # reconstructed from noisy
    axs[2, i].imshow(rec_noisy[i].reshape(28,28), cmap='gray')
    axs[2, i].axis('off')
    axs[2, i].set_title("Reconstructed")

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
```

**Interpretation**:
- The network may remove some noise due to the learned manifold structure, but the reconstruction might be less robust than a full-parameter (untied) autoencoder.

## 7. Advantages and Disadvantages of Tied Weights

| **Advantages**                                       | **Disadvantages**                                          |
|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Reduces the total number of parameters in the model  | Can slightly degrade reconstruction performance or require longer training |
| Less risk of overfitting (fewer parameters to learn) | More complicated to implement manually (especially if model has multiple layers to tie) |
| Enforces a conceptual mirror structure in the layers | Doesn’t necessarily guarantee improved results; performance is data-dependent |

- **Summary**: Tied weights are sometimes useful when model size is critical or you want an *explicitly* mirrored encoder-decoder architecture. For most tasks, standard autoencoders (with separate encoder/decoder weights) may perform just as well or better.

---

## 8. Further Considerations

1. **Bias Terms**  
   - In the above code, we omitted explicit biases for the “middle” layers. We could add `nn.Parameter` for the encoder side and similarly reuse (or omit) it for the decoder side.
2. **Multiple Layers**  
   - If an autoencoder has multiple encoder and decoder layers, one can tie each corresponding pair of layers, but complexity rises.
3. **Sparse / Variational / Convolutional**  
   - Tied weights can combine with other autoencoder variants. E.g., **convolutional** layers can also be “tied” by transposing convolution filters, although typically you’d use `nn.ConvTranspose2d` in the decoder.
4. **Practical Usage**  
   - Tied weights are often *not mandatory* and can even reduce flexibility. Researchers might use them to **reduce model parameters** or to investigate the effects of symmetrical priors in the architecture.

---

## 9. Final Remarks

- **Key Insight**: Implementing tied weights manually in PyTorch requires careful handling of matrix shapes, transposes, and direct usage of `nn.Parameter`.  
- **Take-Home Point**: While it can be beneficial for smaller or more controlled settings, tied-weight autoencoders do not always outperform untied-weight counterparts. They are, however, a valuable concept to understand to appreciate the variety of design decisions possible in neural network architectures.
