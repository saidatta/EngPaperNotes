# ANN: 

> **Overview:**  
> In deep learning, we can define models using the simple, straightforward `nn.Sequential` function or by creating custom classes (subclassing `nn.Module`). While `nn.Sequential` is easy to use for standard feedforward networks, it is also limited in flexibility. Creating your own model classes allows you to implement more sophisticated architectures and custom behaviors in the forward pass.

## Introduction & Motivation

- **`nn.Sequential`:**  
  - **Pros:**  
    - Simple and concise  
    - Easy to read and set up  
    - Ideal for models where layers are stacked one after the other
  - **Cons:**  
    - Limited flexibility  
    - No easy way to incorporate conditional operations, branching, or multiple inputs/outputs

- **Custom Model Classes:**  
  - **Pros:**  
    - Greater flexibility and customizability  
    - Full control over the forward pass (e.g., using loops, conditionals, multiple outputs)  
    - Easier to extend for sophisticated architectures
  - **Cons:**  
    - Requires writing more code  
    - Slightly more complex and demands stronger Python/OOP skills

## Using `nn.Sequential`

`nn.Sequential` is a container module that allows you to stack layers sequentially. All you need to do is list the layers in the order in which the data will pass through them.

**Example:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Define a simple feedforward model using nn.Sequential.
model_seq = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(2, 4),    # Input layer: maps 2 features to 4 hidden units
    nn.ReLU(),          # Activation function: ReLU
    nn.Linear(4, 1),    # Output layer: maps 4 hidden units to 1 output
    nn.Sigmoid()        # Activation function: Sigmoid (for binary output)
)

# Test the sequential model with a sample input.
x = torch.randn(1, 2)  # Example input: batch size 1, 2 features
output_seq = model_seq(x)
print("Output from nn.Sequential model:", output_seq)
```

---

## Defining a Custom Class

By subclassing `nn.Module`, you can define a custom model. This approach requires implementing two key methods:
- **`__init__`:** Initialize the layers (think of this as defining the "nouns" or the objects/characters in your model).
- **`forward`:** Define how the data moves through these layers (the "verbs" or actions on the objects).

**Example:**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F  # For functional operations like F.relu

class Class4ANN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Class4ANN, self).__init__()
        # Define layers (nouns/objects)
        self.input_layer = nn.Linear(2, 4)   # Maps 2 features to 4 hidden units
        self.output_layer = nn.Linear(4, 1)   # Maps 4 hidden units to 1 output

    def forward(self, x):
        # Define the forward pass (verbs/actions)
        # Pass input x through the input layer and apply ReLU activation.
        x = F.relu(self.input_layer(x))
        # Pass the activated output through the output layer and apply Sigmoid.
        x = torch.sigmoid(self.output_layer(x))
        return x

# Create an instance of the custom model.
model_class = Class4ANN()

# Test the custom class model with a sample input.
output_class = model_class(x)
print("Output from custom class model:", output_class)
```

## Code Comparison: Sequential vs. Custom Class

Both code snippets below create **exactly the same model** (input → ReLU → output → Sigmoid) but are defined in different ways:

### Using `nn.Sequential`:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

model_seq = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(2, 4),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(4, 1),
    nn.Sigmoid()
)
```

### Using a Custom Class:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class Class4ANN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Class4ANN, self).__init__()
        self.input_layer = nn.Linear(2, 4)
        self.output_layer = nn.Linear(4, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(self.input_layer(x))
        x = torch.sigmoid(self.output_layer(x))
        return x

model_class = Class4ANN()
```

> **Test Comparison:**
> Running the same input through both models should yield identical (or nearly identical) outputs:
>
> ```python
> x = torch.randn(1, 2)
> output_seq = model_seq(x)
> output_class = model_class(x)
> print("Sequential output:", output_seq)
> print("Custom class output:", output_class)
> ```

## Visualizing the Model Flow

A simple flow diagram helps illustrate how the data is processed in both implementations.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Input Data (x)]
    B[Input Layer (nn.Linear(2,4))]
    C[ReLU Activation]
    D[Output Layer (nn.Linear(4,1))]
    E[Sigmoid Activation]
    F[Final Output]
    
    A --> B
    B --> C
    C --> D
    D --> E
    E --> F
```

- **`nn.Sequential`:** The diagram is implicit because layers are automatically stacked.
- **Custom Class:**  
  - In `__init__`, you define `self.input_layer` and `self.output_layer`.
  - In `forward`, you explicitly call these layers and apply activations.

## Discussion: Pros & Cons

### `nn.Sequential`  
- **Pros:**
  - **Simplicity:** Fewer lines of code and straightforward implementation.
  - **Readability:** Easy for others to understand the stacking order of layers.
- **Cons:**
  - **Limited Flexibility:** Difficult or impossible to include conditional logic, multiple inputs/outputs, or non-sequential data flows.

### Custom Class (Subclassing `nn.Module`)  
- **Pros:**
  - **Flexibility:** Full control over the forward pass; can incorporate loops, conditionals, multiple branches, etc.
  - **Extensibility:** Easier to add custom operations, debugging statements, or specialized layers.
- **Cons:**
  - **Complexity:** More boilerplate code; requires understanding of Python OOP and the structure of `nn.Module`.
  - **Verbosity:** Slightly more code to achieve the same result as `nn.Sequential` for simple models.

## Summary & Further Resources

- **When to Use `nn.Sequential`:**  
  Use it for simple, linear stacks of layers where you don’t need any customization in the forward pass.
  
- **When to Use a Custom Class:**  
  When you require custom behavior (e.g., branching, loops, dynamic layer selection) in your network, subclassing `nn.Module` is the preferred approach.
