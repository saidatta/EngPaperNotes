Below is a comprehensive set of Obsidian notes in Markdown format for the lecture “ANN: CodeChallenge: convert sequential to class.” These notes cover the purpose of the challenge, step‐by‐step explanations of the code conversion process, detailed code examples (including data creation, model definition, training, and testing), and discussions on the results. You can copy and paste this into your Obsidian vault.

> **Purpose:**  
> This code challenge is designed to give you more hands‑on experience converting models built with `nn.Sequential` into models defined via your own custom class (subclassing `nn.Module`). The goal is to exactly replicate an existing model (from the “ANN multilayer” notebook) but using a class definition rather than the simpler, but more limited, `nn.Sequential` method.

## Introduction & Motivation

- **Why Convert?**  
  - Using `nn.Sequential` is simple and fast but is limited in flexibility.
  - Custom model classes let you insert conditional operations, loops, and other custom behaviors in the forward pass.
  - This challenge reinforces your Python class skills and helps you see that both approaches can yield equivalent models.

- **Challenge Goal:**  
  - Start with the “ANN multilayer” notebook.
  - Create a copy of that notebook (so the original is preserved).
  - Reconstruct the model architecture (which remains exactly the same) using your own custom class rather than using `nn.Sequential`.

---

## Challenge Description

- **Task:**  
  Rewrite the model that was originally built using `nn.Sequential` by creating your own class.
  
- **Model Architecture (unchanged):**  
  - **Input Layer:** 2 data features → 16 units  
  - **Hidden Layer(s):** 16 units with ReLU activation  
  - **Output Layer:** 16 units → 1 output (passed through a Sigmoid activation)
  
- **Additional Details:**  
  - The activation between layers is ReLU.
  - The output is passed through a Sigmoid activation.
  - (Optionally, note that you can use either BCE loss on the sigmoid output or use BCEWithLogitsLoss on the raw output; here we choose to apply the sigmoid explicitly.)
  - Import `torch.nn.functional` as `F` for convenience.

## Original Sequential Model Overview

For reference, a typical model using `nn.Sequential` might look like this:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# Original model built with nn.Sequential
model_seq = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(2, 16),   # Input: 2 features to 16 hidden units
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(16, 1),   # Hidden to Output: 16 units to 1 output
    nn.Sigmoid()        # Sigmoid activation for output
)

# Test the sequential model with a sample input
x_sample = torch.randn(1, 2)
print("Sequential Model Output:", model_seq(x_sample))
```

*Note:* The architecture above is what we want to replicate exactly—but using our own class.

---

## Defining the Model as a Custom Class

Below is the code for the converted model. Notice how the custom class (named `CustomANN`) inherits from `nn.Module` and implements the two essential methods: `__init__` and `forward`.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F  # For activation functions

class CustomANN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(CustomANN, self).__init__()
        # Define the layers (this is analogous to the "nouns" in our model)
        self.input_layer = nn.Linear(2, 16)   # Maps 2 features to 16 hidden units
        self.hidden_layer = nn.Linear(16, 1)    # Maps 16 hidden units to 1 output
        
    def forward(self, x):
        # Define the forward pass (this is the "action" or "verbs" in our model)
        # Pass input through input layer and apply ReLU activation
        x = F.relu(self.input_layer(x))
        # Pass through the hidden/output layer
        x = self.hidden_layer(x)
        # Apply sigmoid activation to the output
        x = torch.sigmoid(x)
        return x

# Create an instance of the custom model
model_custom = CustomANN()
print("Custom Class Model:")
print(model_custom)

# Test the custom model with a sample input
x_sample = torch.randn(1, 2)
output_custom = model_custom(x_sample)
print("Custom Model Output:", output_custom)
```

**Explanation:**

- **`__init__`:**  
  - We initialize two layers:
    - `self.input_layer`: Takes the 2-dimensional input and maps it to 16 hidden units.
    - `self.hidden_layer`: Maps from 16 units to the 1 output.
  - These layers are stored as attributes of the model instance.

- **`forward`:**  
  - The input `x` is passed through the input layer, then `F.relu` is applied.
  - The result is then passed through the hidden layer.
  - Finally, `torch.sigmoid` is applied to produce the final output.
  - The forward pass defines the computation graph.

## Training & Testing the Converted Model

Now that the custom model is defined, we need to ensure it works with the rest of our code. Below is an example of creating data, training the model, and checking its performance. (This code mimics what you may have seen in the original ANN multilayer notebook.)

### Data Creation

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# For this challenge, we use the same data generation method as before.
# For example, we can use synthetic data or the Iris dataset.
# Here, we provide a simple example with random data:

# Create synthetic data: 100 samples, 2 features each
np.random.seed(42)
X_data = np.random.randn(100, 2)
y_data = (np.random.rand(100) > 0.5).astype(np.float32)  # Binary target (0 or 1)

# Convert to PyTorch tensors
X_tensor = torch.tensor(X_data, dtype=torch.float32)
y_tensor = torch.tensor(y_data, dtype=torch.float32).view(-1, 1)
```

### Training Function

Below is a simple training loop that uses Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss. (Recall: since our custom model applies sigmoid, we can use BCELoss.)

```python
import torch.optim as optim

def train_model(model, X, y, num_epochs=250, learning_rate=0.01):
    # Define loss function and optimizer
    criterion = nn.BCELoss()  # Since our output is passed through sigmoid
    optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)
    
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        model.train()
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(X)
        loss = criterion(outputs, y)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        
        if (epoch+1) % 50 == 0:
            print(f"Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Loss: {loss.item():.4f}")
    
    # Evaluate the model (for simplicity, accuracy for binary classification)
    model.eval()
    with torch.no_grad():
        outputs = model(X)
        predictions = (outputs > 0.5).float()
        accuracy = (predictions == y).float().mean().item() * 100
    return accuracy

# Train the custom model
accuracy_custom = train_model(model_custom, X_tensor, y_tensor, num_epochs=250, learning_rate=0.01)
print(f"Custom Model Final Accuracy: {accuracy_custom:.2f}%")
```

### Running the Complete Code

When you run the entire notebook (or script), you should observe that:
- The custom class model produces outputs equivalent to the `nn.Sequential` version.
- The training loop runs without errors.
- The final accuracy is similar to what you expect from the original model.

*Tip:* Compare the outputs and training logs to the original notebook to ensure that only the model definition has changed.

## Discussion & Observations

- **Key Learning Outcome:**  
  You have successfully converted an `nn.Sequential` model to a custom model class while keeping the architecture identical.

- **Flexibility & Future Use:**  
  This exercise gives you the freedom to modify the model’s forward pass and incorporate more complex behavior as you progress in your deep learning research.

- **Practical Tip:**  
  Always run a small test pass through the model (with dummy data) to verify that the output shape and data flow are as expected before starting full-scale training.

- **Observing Training Behavior:**  
  In one run you might see a low accuracy (e.g., 50%) in early epochs and then, as training progresses, the accuracy can jump (e.g., to 98.5%)—a behavior you may have observed in previous experiments.

## Additional Notes & References

- **Using `torch.nn.functional`:**  
  - This module provides many functions (like `F.relu`) that allow you to apply activations without needing to create layer objects.
  
- **Alternative Approaches:**  
  - Instead of applying `torch.sigmoid` in the forward pass, you could omit it and use `BCEWithLogitsLoss` for improved numerical stability.
