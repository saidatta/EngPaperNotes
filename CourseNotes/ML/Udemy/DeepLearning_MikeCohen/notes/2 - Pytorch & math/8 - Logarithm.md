-  Logarithms or log functions are important in machine learning, optimization, and deep learning.
-   Deep learning is essentially an optimization problem.
-   Natural exponent (e^x) is a strictly positive function and is related to the natural log.

## Natural Log (ln)

-   The natural log is the inverse of the natural exponent.
-   The plot of the natural log function bends the other way compared to the natural exponent function.
-   It is a monotonic function, which means that when x goes up, the log also goes up, and when x goes down, the log goes down.
-   A monotonic function is important for optimization and deep learning because minimizing x is the same as minimizing the log of x.
-   The logarithm is only defined for positive values of x.
-   The logarithm stretches out small values of x, better distinguishing small numbers that are closely spaced to each other.
-   In deep learning, we often minimize small quantities like probability values and loss values that are close to zero.
-   Minimizing the log is computationally easier than minimizing the original probability values.

## Bases of Logarithms

-   Natural log (ln): Base e
-   Log base 2: Base 2
-   Log base 10: Base 10
-   All log bases are monotonic functions of x, stretch out small values of x, and are defined only for positive values.
-   The slope differs between log bases.
-   Natural log is the most commonly used base due to its relationship with e, which fits nicely with sigmoid and softmax functions.

## Logarithm in Python

`import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  x = np.linspace(0.01, 1, 200) log_x = np.log(x)  plt.plot(x, log_x) plt.xlabel('x') plt.ylabel('log(x)') plt.show()`

`x = np.linspace(0.01, 1, 200) log_x = np.log(x) exp_x = np.exp(x)  plt.plot(x, np.exp(log_x), label="e^(ln(x))") plt.plot(x, np.log(exp_x), label="ln(e^(x))") plt.plot(x, x, label="x") plt.legend() plt.show()`
