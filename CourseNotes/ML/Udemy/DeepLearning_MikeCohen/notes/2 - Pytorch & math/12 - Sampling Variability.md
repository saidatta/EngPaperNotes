### Notes:

1. Deep learning requires a large number of samples to train models.

2. Random sampling:
- Process of selecting a subset of individuals from a population to estimate the population parameters.
- Required for deep learning models to learn effectively.

3. Sampling variability:
- Different randomly selected samples from the same population can have different values of the same measurement.
- A single measurement is likely to be an unreliable estimate of a population parameter.
- More variability in the population means we need more samples to approximate the true population mean.
- Law of large numbers: The larger the samples we take, the better we can estimate the true underlying statistics.

4. Sources of sampling variability:
- Natural variations in biology and physics.
- Measurement noise due to imperfect sensors.
- Complex systems with variables that depend on or interact with other variables.
- Random and unpredictable nature of the universe.

5. Dealing with sampling variability:
- Take larger and more numerous samples to compute an average.
- Random sampling helps to avoid non-representative or biased sampling, which can cause overfitting and limit generalizability.

6. Importance of random sampling in deep learning:
- Deep learning models learn by examples, so we need a large number of examples to learn effectively.
- Non-random or biased sampling can introduce systematic biases into deep learning models and prevent them from learning correctly.

7. Demonstration of sampling variability using Python:
- Generate a population of numbers and compute the population mean.
- Select random samples from the population and compute the sample mean.
- Observe how the sample mean varies with different random samples.
- As the number of experiments increases, the average of the sample means gets closer to the true population mean (Law of large numbers).

Equations/Examples:

1. Law of large numbers: As the number of samples (n) approaches infinity, the sample mean approaches the population mean.

2. Python code to illustrate sampling variability:
```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate a population of numbers
population = np.random.randn(1000) * 10 + 1.65

# Compute the population mean
population_mean = np.mean(population)

# Select random samples from the population and compute the sample mean
sample_means = []
num_experiments = 10000
sample_size = 5

for i in range(num_experiments):
    sample = np.random.choice(population, sample_size)
    sample_mean = np.mean(sample)
    sample_means.append(sample_mean)

# Plot the histogram of sample means
plt.hist(sample_means, bins=50, alpha=0.7)
plt.axvline(population_mean, color='magenta', linestyle='--', linewidth=2)
plt.xlabel("Sample Mean")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.title("Sampling Variability")
plt.show()
```
