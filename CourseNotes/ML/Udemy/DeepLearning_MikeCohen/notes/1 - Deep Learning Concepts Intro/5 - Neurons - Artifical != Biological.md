# Introduction
- Dislike for the term "artificial neural networks"
- Deep learning is amazing, but calling units in deep learning models "artificial neurons" is misleading and outdated
- Aim: To show why artificial neurons have little to do with actual neurons in the brain
# Actual Neurons
- Real neurons are complex, with various morphologies, activity patterns, and molecular signatures
- Neurons can be connected to hundreds or thousands of other neurons
- No established taxonomy of neurons; we don't fully understand their complexity and categorization

# Artificial Neurons Are Not Like Real Neurons
- Artificial neurons in deep learning models are simple compared to the mind-boggling complexity of real neurons
- Real neurons perform various computations simultaneously, such as coincidence detection, logical operations, filtering, attenuation, segregation, and amplification
- Real neurons have ion channels that are regulated on different timescales and are affected by different genetic factors
# Origin of Artificial Neurons
- The artificial neuron concept was developed by McCulloch and Pitts in the 1930s, based on limited data and knowledge about real neurons
- While their work was groundbreaking, it's outdated today, and the concept should no longer be considered a good model for real neurons
# Blender Analogy
- Comparing an artificial neuron to a real neuron is like comparing a blender to a human being
- Both humans and blenders process food, make noise, and use electricity, but these superficial similarities don't mean that one is a good model for the other
- Similarly, artificial neurons should not be considered good models for real neurons
# Moving Forward
- It's important to appreciate the differences between artificial and real neurons
- By not constraining deep learning models to mimic the brain, we can be more imaginative and innovative in developing new models
- Although the terminology is problematic, the focus should be on the potential of deep learning technology to improve human society

# Conclusion
- Artificial neurons in deep learning models are nothing like real neurons
- Recognizing this difference can help advance deep learning technology without being constrained by outdated concepts
- Deep learning should be celebrated for its potential to improve human society, rather than being compared to the human brain
