Summary:
This chapter discusses the high-level concepts related to deep learning and artificial intelligence, the philosophy of deep learning, its impact on science and engineering, and the potential for AI consciousness.

Notes:

1. Intelligence and Artificial Intelligence
   - No clear definition of intelligence
   - Artificial intelligence (AI) is even more mysterious and poorly defined
   - Many AI claims are just marketing and not true manifestations of artificial intelligence

2. Deep learning as a promising avenue in AI
   - Deep learning is built from very simple individual parts
   - The whole system becomes complex when these simple parts are repeated many times
   - Documentary recommendation: "Fast, Cheap and Out of Control"

3. Philosophy of Deep Learning
   - Deep learning is fundamentally empirical, not theoretical
   - It does not develop solutions from first principles
   - Models learn from data, tinkering, and exploration
   - This is a radical shift from traditional scientific and engineering approaches

4. Blind trust in deep learning technology
   - We don't fully understand deep learning models and their representations
   - This trust is different from trusting technologies like cars or phones

5. Replacing rigorous theories with black box approximations
   - The universe is incredibly complex
   - Deep learning allows models to learn the complexity without human imposition
   - The Universal Approximation Theorem states that a sufficiently rich deep learning model can approximate any mathematical function

6. Deep learning's impact on science and engineering
   - Deep learning models have solved complex problems in various fields, such as molecular biology and mechanical engineering
   - This could be a positive development for scientific progress

7. AI consciousness
   - No one knows if AI can become conscious
   - AI consciousness might be very different from human consciousness
   - The only known requirement for consciousness is a human brain and body
   - The position on AI consciousness should be agnostic

Equations: None

Figures: None

Examples:
- Distinguishing BMW from Mercedes using deep learning
- Walking robots that do not have muscles, nerves, or bones

Thought-provoking points:
- Continue thinking about the nature of intelligence, the role of deep learning in science and progression of human knowledge, and consciousness throughout the course.
