## Introduction to Caches
- **Purpose**: Caches are critical for computer system performance. They bridge the gap between fast CPU speeds and slower memory access speeds.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Memory Wall**: The growing disparity between CPU speed and memory access speed. CPU speed increases more rapidly than memory speed, leading to a bottleneck.
  - **Cache**: A smaller, faster memory located between the CPU and main memory. It stores frequently accessed data to improve overall performance.
## Why Caches?
- **Performance and Security**: Caches primarily address performance issues in computer systems, but they also have implications for security.
- **Exponential Growth**: The gap between CPU and memory speed widens approximately 18% per year.
## Cache Mechanics
- **CPU and Memory**: The CPU is faster than main memory. Caches act as an intermediary, providing faster access to data.
- **Cache Size**: Caches are smaller than main memory due to the expense and physical limitations of fast memory.
- **Hit Rate**: Modern CPUs require a cache hit rate over 99% to achieve peak performance.
## Principle of Locality
- **Temporal Locality**: Data accessed recently is likely to be accessed again soon.
- **Spatial Locality**: Data near recently accessed data is likely to be accessed soon.
- **Effectiveness**: Without locality, caches would be ineffective.
## Cache Lines
- **Concept**: When data is accessed, an entire cache line (containing that data and nearby data) is loaded.
- **Spatial Locality Usage**: This approach leverages spatial locality by prefetching adjacent data.
## Cache Access Granularity
- **CPU vs. Cache**: CPUs access memory in smaller units (bytes or words) compared to caches.
- **Cache Line Size**: Typically 32 or 64 bytes.
## Memory Fetching Costs
- **Components**: Setup time and transfer time.
- **Setup Time**: Independent of the amount of data fetched; incurred once per transaction.
- **Transfer Time**: Depends on the amount of data; linear relationship.
- **Efficiency**: Fetching larger blocks of data (like cache lines) amortizes setup time, increasing efficiency.
## Cache Allocation and Metadata
- **Allocation Unit**: Cache line.
- **Metadata**:
  - **Valid Bit**: Indicates if the line contains valid data.
  - **Modified Bit**: Indicates if the data has been altered (dirty) and needs to be written back to memory.
  - **Tag**: Used to determine if the requested data is in the cache line.
  - **Statistics**: Used for cache replacement policies.
## Cache Access Methods
- **Virtually vs. Physically Indexed**: Determines whether the cache uses virtual or physical memory addresses.
- **MMU Role**: Translates virtual addresses to physical addresses.
## Cache Hierarchies
- **Levels**: Modern systems often have multiple levels of caches (L1, L2, etc.).
- **Shared vs. Private**: Some caches are shared across cores, while others are private to a single core.
## Cache Structures
- **Lines and Sets**: Caches consist of lines grouped into sets.
- **Indexing**: Determines which set a particular piece of data maps to.
- **Associativity**: Defines the number of lines per set.
### Types of Caches
1. **Direct Mapped Cache**: Each index points to a single line.
2. **Set Associative Cache**: Multiple lines per set.
3. **Fully Associative Cache**: Only one set; any line can store any data.

### Cache Efficiency
- **Low Associativity**: Higher conflict rates, potentially lower hit rates.
- **High Associativity**: Lower conflict rates but slower and more power-intensive.

## Types of Cache Organization

### 1. Direct Mapped Cache
- **Simplicity**: One line per set.
- **Indexing**: Index bits used to directly access cache lines.
- **Tag Matching**: Validates if the correct data is in the cache line.
### 2. Set Associative Cache
- **Structure**: Multiple lines per set (e.g., two-way associative cache).
- **Indexing and Tag Matching**: More than one tag is matched per set, increasing complexity but reducing conflict misses.
### 3. Fully Associative Cache
- **One Set**: Contains all lines; no indexing.
- **Multiple Tag Matching**: Increases complexity and power consumption.
- **Slower and Power Hungry**: Due to deep logic and multiple simultaneous operations.
## Cache and Virtual Memory Interference
- **Page Size and Cache Indexing**: Cache indexing can interfere with virtual memory paging.
- **Overlap in Addressing**: Index bits may partially overlap with page offset bits, affecting cache behavior.
- **Cache Coloring**: Memory gets 'colored' based on how its addresses map onto cache sets.
- **Implications**: Certain virtual addresses may only be stored in specific parts of the cache.
## Cache Misses and Their Types (The Four C's)
1. **Compulsory Misses**: First-time access to a cache line.
2. **Capacity Misses**: Occur when the cache is full.
3. **Conflict Misses**: Caused by limited associativity of the cache.
4. **Coherence Misses**: In multicore systems, keeping caches consistent across cores.
## Cache Replacement Policies
- **Necessity**: Required when a cache miss occurs and the relevant set is full.
- **Decisions**: Determining which line to replace when fetching new data.
- **Impact on Performance**: Influences how efficiently the cache operates under different workloads.

2. **Example**: Visualizing cache coloring and its impact on memory access patterns.
3. **Equation**: Calculating the probability of each type of cache miss under given workloads.

## Cache Replacement Policies

- **Context**: When a cache line must be replaced due to a cache miss.
- **Least Recently Used (LRU)**: Prefers keeping lines that were accessed recently.
  - **Pathological Case**: Sequential access patterns can lead to poor LRU performance.
- **First In, First Out (FIFO)**: Replaces the oldest line in the cache.
- **Random Replacement**: Selects a random line to replace.
- **Write Policies**:
  - **Write-Back**: Accumulates writes in the cache and writes them back only when the line is replaced.
  - **Write-Through**: Writes data to both the cache and the memory simultaneously.

## Cache Indexing and Tagging

- **Virtually Indexed, Virtually Tagged (VIVT)**: Uses virtual addresses for both indexing and tagging.
  - **Drawbacks**: Requires MMU involvement for access control, larger tag sizes.
- **Virtually Indexed, Physically Tagged (VIPT)**: Uses virtual addresses for indexing and physical addresses for tagging.
  - **Advantages**: Balances the speed of virtual indexing with the accuracy of physical tagging.
- **Physically Indexed, Physically Tagged (PIPT)**: Uses physical addresses for both indexing and tagging.
  - **Preferred for L2 and higher caches**: Ensures consistency and simplicity in implementation.
- **Single Color Caches**: When index bits are completely within the page offset, leading to no difference between virtual and physical indexing.

## Trade-offs and Considerations

- **Tag Size**: In VIPT caches, tags need to be larger to accommodate the entire address range.
- **Hardware Complexity**: Implementing LRU or other complex policies in hardware can be challenging.
- **Memory Transactions**: Write-back policies aim to reduce the number of memory transactions, improving performance.

## Impact of Caches on System Performance and Correctness

### Homonyms and Synonyms in Caching
- **Homonyms**: Different data with the same 'name' (address) in different address spaces.
  - **Problem**: In VIVT (Virtually Indexed, Virtually Tagged) caches, leads to potential correctness issues.
- **Synonyms**: Same data accessed via different addresses.
  - **Problem**: Can cause data inconsistency in caches, particularly with write-back caches.
### Cache Maintenance for DMA
- **Direct Memory Access (DMA)**: Typically bypasses the cache, leading to potential inconsistencies.
- **Cache Flushing**: Ensuring data consistency by flushing cache lines before DMA operations.
### Cache Bomb Scenario
- **Description**: A scenario where a cached line remains in the cache after its associated memory is unmapped, potentially leading to random memory changes upon cache line eviction.
### Cache Policies to Address Synonyms
- **Hardware Synonym Detection**: Detects and handles synonyms within the cache, maintaining consistency.
- **Mapping Restrictions**: Restricting memory mappings to maintain consistency in cache color.
### Cache Indexing and Tagging Revisited
- **VIVT Caches**: Prone to both homonym and synonym problems, leading to their decline in use.
- **VIPT Caches**: Avoid homonym issues but still susceptible to synonym issues unless single-colored.
- **PIPT Caches**: The simplest and most reliable, avoiding both homonym and synonym issues.
### Multi-Core and Cache Coherency
- **Cache Snooping**: Ensures cache coherency in multi-core systems.
- **Trend Towards Physically Indexed Caches**: Due to their simplicity and reliability in multi-core environments.

## Cache Hierarchies and Write Buffers

### Write Buffers
- **Purpose**: To buffer write transactions to avoid stalling the CPU.
- **Structure**: Simple FIFO (First In, First Out) buffers.
- **Implications for Multi-Core Systems**: Can lead to weak memory models due to differing views of memory between cores.

### Cache Hierarchy Levels
- **L1, L2, L3 Caches**: Varying levels of cache with increasing size and decreasing speed.
- **Right Buffers at Each Level**: To manage write transactions efficiently.

### Harvard Architecture in Caches
- **Separate Instruction and Data Caches (I-Cache and D-Cache)**: Optimizes cache efficiency by separating instruction fetches and data accesses.
- **Read-Only I-Cache**: Simplifies and optimizes cache for instruction fetching.

## Translation Lookaside Buffers (TLBs)

### TLB Architecture
- **Function**: Caches page table entries, aiding in faster virtual-to-physical address translation.
- **Typically Hardware-Loaded**: Modern systems predominantly use hardware-loaded TLBs.

### Levels of TLBs
- **Multiple Levels**: Like caches, TLBs can have multiple levels to balance size and speed.
- **Small L1 TLBs**: For fast, single-cycle address translation.
- **Larger L2 TLBs**: To back up the smaller L1 TLB.

### Evolution of TLB Size
- **Historical Context**: Comparing TLB sizes and capabilities over the past decades.
- **Modern TLB Capabilities**: Handling of multiple page sizes and entries.
