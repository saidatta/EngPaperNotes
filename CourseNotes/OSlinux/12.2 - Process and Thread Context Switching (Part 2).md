## 1. Overview
**Timestamp ~18:24**  
In this portion of the lecture, we explore **three types** of context switches:
1. **Full Process Context Switch**  
2. **Thread Context Switch**  
3. **Interrupt Context Switch**  
Each has different degrees of overhead related to saving/restoring state, changing page tables, and potentially flushing the TLB.
---
## 2. Full Process Context Switch
A **full process context switch** occurs when the OS moves the CPU from one process to another **completely separate** process.  
1. **Definition**:  
   - The process is not part of the same thread group as the currently running process. (In many OS designs, a multi-threaded process’s threads share the same address space; a “different process” implies a different address space.)
2. **Consequence**:
   - Must save the entire hardware context of the old process.
   - Must load a different address space (i.e., different `CR3` value in x86, which means a TLB flush).
   - High overhead because reloading `CR3` **invalidates** TLB entries, causing more TLB misses thereafter.

> **Key Idea**: The OS tries to reduce how often this happens by:
> - Time-slicing so that the same process can continue if it’s still eligible.
> - Avoiding unnecessary process switches if, for instance, running threads are available in the current process or kernel mode.

## 3. Thread Context Switch
**Timestamp ~25:00 →**  
Within the **same process** (a group of threads sharing the same address space), we can switch from one thread to another:
### 3.1 Threads in the Same Process
- **Shared address space**: All threads in a thread group share:
  - Code segment (`.text`)
  - Data/BSS
  - Heap
  - **But** each thread has:
    - Its **own stack**
    - Its **own Thread-Local Storage (TLS)** region
- **Why is switching cheaper than a full process switch?**  
  - Because the entire page-table mapping remains **the same** across threads in the same group.  
  - No need to flush TLB or update `CR3` — the kernel does **not** have to switch to a different address space.

> **Analogy**: If everyone is speaking English (same address space), we keep using the same English dictionary (same page table). Only when we switch to a Hindi speaker (a different process) do we swap dictionaries (flush TLB, load new page table).

### 3.2 Mechanics of a Thread Switch
When switching from thread T1 to thread T2 (same process):
1. **Save hardware context** (registers, flags, program counter) of T1.
2. **Update current task pointer** (e.g., `current = T2`).
3. **Restore hardware context** of T2.
4. **Switch stack pointers** to T2’s **user stack** or **kernel stack** (depending on if we are in kernel mode).

> We do **not** reload `CR3` or flush the TLB because the address space is unchanged.
### 3.3 How are thread stacks organized?
One common approach:  
- **Single shared address space** for the process.  
- Reserve different non-overlapping ranges (or “slots”) within that address space for each thread’s stack.  
  - Example:
```plaintext
  +-------------------------+
  |  ... (shared code)     |
  |  ... (shared data)     |
  |  ... (shared heap)     |
  |-------------------------|
  |  Thread 1 stack        |
  |-------------------------|
  |  Thread 2 stack        |
  |-------------------------|
  |  Thread 3 stack        |
  +-------------------------+
```

Each thread uses its own stack pointer to reference its allocated stack region.
- **Thread-Local Storage (TLS)**: Similarly, each thread can have a private section for local data. This is also somewhere in the shared address space, but each thread’s code sees it mapped at a known location (or with a TLS pointer register like `FS`, `GS` on x86).
**Benefit**: No TLB flush needed; only a CPU register context switch and a stack pointer switch.

## 4. Interrupt Context Switch

**Timestamp ~33:30 →**
An **interrupt context switch** occurs when external hardware triggers an interrupt (e.g., keyboard input, network packet arrival, timer interrupt).
### 4.1 Promotion to Kernel Mode
- **No separate interrupt thread** is spawned. Instead, the **current running thread** is **promoted** to kernel mode to handle the interrupt (“top half”).
- The thread uses an **interrupt stack** specific to that CPU or interrupt vector. This stack is separate from the user-mode stack:

    - Security and reliability reasons: Kernel data must not be accessible to user code.
        
    - Minimizes corruption or mixing with user data.
### 4.2 Top Half vs. Bottom Half

- **Top half**:
    
    - Very short, minimal code segment that runs at high priority to quickly service the hardware.
        
    - Usually does only critical tasks (e.g., acknowledging the device, reading a small piece of data).
        
    - Often must avoid locking or complex blocking operations, as it can lead to deadlocks or prevent other interrupts from being handled.
        
- **Bottom half** (or “deferred work”):
    
    - Scheduled by the top half if more complicated processing is needed.
        
    - Runs as a normal **kernel thread** (with typical scheduling).
        
    - Can safely block, acquire locks, etc.
        

### 4.3 Address Space Implications

- Since interrupt handling occurs in the **kernel address space**, no TLB flush or page-table switch is needed (the kernel portion is identical for all processes).
    
- The interrupt uses a **dedicated interrupt stack** (one per CPU or per interrupt vector), so it does not interfere with the user stack.

## 5. Putting It All Together: When Do We Flush TLB?

**Timestamp ~22:00 → and ~32:00 →**

Recall the four canonical transitions:

1. **User → Kernel** (system call or interrupt):
    
    - **No TLB flush**, no `CR3` update needed.
        
    - We simply switch to kernel mode in the **same** address space.
        
2. **Kernel → Kernel**:
    
    - E.g., switching from one kernel thread to another or returning to the scheduler within the kernel.
        
    - **No TLB flush**, same kernel address space.
        
3. **Kernel → User** (return to user mode):
    
    - **Same user process**: No flush needed (same address space).
        
    - **Different user process**: Must change `CR3` → TLB flush.
        

> **User → User** is not a direct transition; it always goes via kernel → user.

Hence, the only time we pay the big cost of TLB flush and page table switch is going from kernel to **a different user process**.

**Why does this matter?**

- A TLB flush is expensive. The OS tries to schedule the same process whenever possible to avoid the flush penalty.

## 6. Code Snippets & Examples

### 6.1 Conceptual Kernel Pseudocode for a Thread Switch

```c
// Switch from thread t1 to thread t2 in the SAME process
void thread_switch(thread_t *t1, thread_t *t2) {
    // 1. Save t1's CPU registers somewhere (e.g., its kernel stack or TCB)
    save_context(t1);

    // 2. Update 'current' pointer
    current = t2;

    // 3. Load t2's saved context
    load_context(t2);

    // 4. Switch to t2's stack pointer
    set_stack_pointer(t2->kernel_stack_pointer);

    // 5. Resume execution in t2
    // (usually a 'return from switch' or jump to scheduler epilogue)
}
```

> Note: This is conceptual; real kernels have assembly-level routines (like `switch_to`) that do similar steps.

### 6.2 Interrupt Handling (Top Half)

```c
// Pseudocode for an interrupt service routine (top half)
interrupt_handler() {
    // CPU is in kernel mode automatically
    // 1. Switch to interrupt stack for this CPU/IRQ
    switch_to_interrupt_stack();

    // 2. Acknowledge hardware device
    ack_device_interrupt();

    // 3. Possibly queue bottom-half work if needed
    schedule_deferred_work();

    // 4. Return from interrupt => original thread resumes
}
```

**Key Points**:

- No need to flush TLB.
    
- We just switch stacks to the CPU’s interrupt stack.
    
- The “bottom half” will run later as a normal kernel context or kernel thread.

## 7. Visualizations

### 7.1 Shared Address Space for Threads

```plaintext
Process "P"
+-----------------------------+ High addresses
| Kernel Space (shared)      | <--- same across entire system
+-----------------------------+ 
|   .text (shared)           | \
|   .data, .bss (shared)     |  > same for all threads in "P"
|   heap (shared)            | /
|-----------------------------|
|  Thread 1 stack            |  T1
|-----------------------------|
|  Thread 2 stack            |  T2
|-----------------------------|
|  Thread 3 stack            |  T3
+-----------------------------+ Low addresses
```

### 7.2 Interrupt Stack Concept

```plaintext
CPU Handling Interrupt:
        +---------------------+    (Interrupt stack - belongs to CPU or IRQ)
        |   top-half code    | <- short code, runs quickly
        |---------------------|
        |   bottom-half code | <- scheduled later as kernel thread, if needed
        +---------------------+

User stack
  |--- belongs to user thread
  |--- unaffected except that user thread is paused
```

## 8. Major Insights and Performance Rationale

1. **Minimize TLB Flushes**
    
    - A TLB flush is triggered by changing `CR3` on x86.
        
    - We only want to do this if we **must** switch to a different address space (i.e., different process).
        
2. **Kernel’s Shared Mapping**
    
    - All kernel threads share the same high-memory region, so no flush on kernel-to-kernel transitions.
        
    - A user thread, when making a system call, uses the **same** address space → no flush.
        
3. **Threads in the Same Process**
    
    - Share the same address space → no flush.
        
    - Only stack pointer and CPU context differ.
        
4. **Interrupts**
    
    - Handled within the same kernel address space → no flush.
        
    - Short “top half” for immediate hardware servicing, longer “bottom half” runs as a standard kernel thread if needed.
        

This design **significantly reduces** overhead by avoiding expensive TLB flushes for the majority of transitions.

## 9. Summary

- **Full process switch**: Full context save/restore + TLB flush + `CR3` update.
    
- **Thread switch (same process)**: Quick, only register + stack pointer changes, **no** TLB flush.
    
- **Interrupt switch**: CPU is promoted to kernel mode, uses interrupt stack, no TLB changes.
    

**Hence**: The OS design ensures minimal disturbance of page tables and TLB by leveraging a shared kernel mapping and shared user address space among threads of the same process.
