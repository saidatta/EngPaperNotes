> **Operating Systems (Smruti R. Sarangi): Context Switch Details II**

These notes provide a deep dive into **how system calls and interrupts** save and restore CPU contexts on x86_64, the assembly-level entry points, stack pointer handling, and important nuances around returning to user mode. Code snippets, explanations, diagrams, and bullet points are included to illustrate the entire flow.

**Lecture: Operating Systems (Smruti R. Sarangi)**  
**Topic**: Saving and Restoring CPU State during System Calls & Interrupts on x86_64

---
## 1. Overview

This lecture continues from the previous discussion of how processes/threads switch between **user mode** and **kernel mode** (and vice versa). The focus is on **low-level details** of what happens on **system calls** and **interrupts**:
- How the **hardware** and **kernel assembly** code save CPU registers (especially instruction pointer, flags, stack pointer).
- Where these values are stored (e.g., the **TSS** segment, model-specific registers, kernel stack).
- The **reverse process** of restoring the state and returning to user mode.
- Differences between **planned** events (system calls) vs **unplanned** events (interrupts).
Understanding these steps is crucial to see how an OS safely transitions from user-mode code into privileged kernel code (for either system calls or interrupts) and how it then switches back or context-switches to a new process.

## 2. x86_64 Assembly Entry Points

**Timestamp ~0:42 →**  
On Linux/x86_64 (and similar OSes), the core context-switch code for **system calls** and **interrupts** often resides in low-level assembly files. For example:

- **`arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S`** (Linux naming)
- `entry_SYSCALL_64`, `ret_from_sys_call` are typical labels or macros.

### 2.1 System Call Entry

- There's a dedicated assembly label, e.g., **`entry_SYSCALL_64`** or `entry_SYSENTER_64`, that the hardware jumps to when a **syscall** instruction is executed in user mode.
- The hardware automatically places some values in registers (e.g., `rcx`, `r11`) or on the stack depending on the exact instruction (e.g., `SYSENTER`, `SYSCALL`).  
  - **`SYSCALL`** (in AMD64 or Intel 64) typically saves `RIP` (the return address) in `RCX` and `RFLAGS` in `R11`.  
  - On the other hand, **interrupts** push the `RIP`, `CS`, and `RFLAGS` onto the **stack**, because interrupts are unplanned.

**Key difference**:  
- A **system call** is **planned**: the user-mode code explicitly issues a `syscall` instruction, so the kernel can assume certain registers (`rcx`/`r11`) are free to hold return info.  
- An **interrupt** is **unplanned**: the CPU does not assume anything about free registers. Instead, the CPU **pushes** the old `RIP`, `CS`, and `RFLAGS` onto the kernel stack to ensure they’re not lost.

---

## 3. Saving the Context on a System Call

**Timestamp ~1:00 →**  

### 3.1 Hardware Steps

1. **Automatic saving** (for `SYSCALL`):
   - The CPU copies the **program counter** (user `RIP`) into `RCX`.  
   - The CPU copies the **flags** (`RFLAGS`) into `R11`.
2. **Push of the code segment** (if needed). For system calls, on x86_64, some details differ from older 32-bit mode. In 64-bit SYSCALL, the CPU does **not** push `CS`, `SS` automatically as the old x86 interrupt mechanism did.  
3. **Model-Specific Registers (MSRs)**: The CPU might reference certain MSRs to determine the **kernel code entry point** and the stack pointer to use for ring 0. For instance, `MSR_LSTAR` holds the address of the SYSCALL entry routine in 64-bit mode.

### 3.2 Additional OS/Assembly Steps

Because `RCX` and `R11` now hold critical user-state info, the kernel assembly entry code must:

- **Save `RCX` and `R11`** onto the **kernel stack** (or some temporary structure) so we don’t lose them.
- Potentially **disable interrupts** briefly while performing the most sensitive part of context saving. An interrupt arriving mid-sequence could corrupt partial state.

**Why not store the stack pointer here?**  
- For `SYSCALL`, we know that we’re switching from a **user stack** to a **kernel stack**. That new kernel stack must be set in order to push further saved registers. If we overwrite the stack pointer before storing its old value, we lose the old user stack pointer.  
- **Hence**: The CPU uses a special mechanism (via TSS or the Star MSRs) to locate the kernel stack pointer, while the old user stack pointer is either still in `RSP` or stored in a known place.  

### 3.3 TSS (Task State Segment) Usage

- On **interrupts** or ring transitions, x86_64 can use the **TSS** to know what kernel `RSP` to load.  
- **Why TSS?**: Because if we are in user mode, the kernel must load a new stack pointer (`RSP`) from somewhere. The TSS can hold the ring 0 stack pointer for each CPU. Once the kernel has loaded that pointer, it can begin pushing or saving register state on the kernel stack.

---

## 4. Saving the Context on an Interrupt (Unplanned)

**Timestamp ~2:03 →**  

For **interrupts** (e.g. hardware IRQ, exceptions, etc.):

- The CPU **automatically** pushes:
  - **`RIP`** (user or kernel)
  - **`CS`** (code segment)
  - **`RFLAGS`**
  - **Potentially `SS` and old `RSP`** if transitioning from user mode to kernel mode
- It does this push onto the **kernel stack** if ring changes from user→kernel, or onto the current stack if in kernel mode. The CPU uses the **TSS** to get the ring 0 `RSP` if in user mode.
- Because an interrupt is unplanned, the CPU cannot assume `RCX` or `R11` are free. Instead, it must push `RIP` and `RFLAGS` onto the stack. This is how the OS later knows where to resume.

---

## 5. Detailed Sequence for x86_64 System Call (SYSCALL)

**Timestamp ~4:00 →**  

1. **CPU sets up**:
   - `RCX = user RIP` (where to return after system call)
   - `R11 = user RFLAGS`
   - Switch stack to kernel stack (using TSS or MSR `STAR/SF_MASK`).
2. **Kernel assembly**:
   - Saves the new `RSP` (old user stack pointer) in some per-thread structure or on the kernel stack.  
   - Saves `RCX` and `R11` on the kernel stack (these contain user RIP and flags).  
   - Possibly saves `GS` segment register by swapping it with a MSR if required. (On Linux, this might store `GSBASE` somewhere or swap to `kernelgsbase`.)
   - **Disable interrupts** while the partial state is being pushed, to avoid an interrupt messing up partial saves.
   - Finally, pushes **all other general-purpose registers** (`RAX`, `RBX`, `RDI`, `RSI`, `RDX`, etc.) onto the kernel stack in a known order, so the C function (system call handler) sees them in a standard calling convention.

**Note**: The **`SYSCALL`** / **`SYSRET`** pair does not automatically save and restore all general-purpose registers. The kernel assembly stub does that manually.

---

## 6. Loading the Kernel Stack

**Timestamp ~5:36 →**  

**Once** the hardware or the assembly stub picks the **kernel stack pointer** (usually from the TSS), it does something like:

1. `movq per_cpu_gsbase, %gs` or an equivalent step to configure segment registers if needed.
2. `movq TSS->RSP0, %RSP` or a variant of this. (Conceptually.)
3. Then the assembly code can safely **push** register values onto `%RSP` (which is now the kernel stack).

The key reason:  
- **We can’t overwrite `RSP`** with the kernel stack pointer until we have stored the old (user) `RSP` somewhere safe. The TSS or a dedicated register ensures we can retrieve it if needed (particularly for returning to user mode).

### 6.1 Important Observations

- The OS can’t reorder these steps arbitrarily. They **must** be done in a precise sequence. For instance, if we set the kernel stack pointer first, we lose the user stack pointer info or could corrupt user data. If we skip saving `rcx`/`r11`, we lose the user return IP/flags.

- **Interrupt disabling** is critical so no further interrupt/trap steps in and tries to push more onto a partially established stack or modifies the same set of registers.

---

## 7. Restoring the Context to Return

**Timestamp ~9:44 →**  

When returning from the kernel to user mode (for a **system call return** or **interrupt return**), the steps are reversed:

1. The kernel code (in C or assembly) will **pop** general registers from the kernel stack into CPU registers. (Or it might do partial restoration.)
2. Possibly re-enable interrupts if they were disabled.
3. Prepare to reload `RIP` and `RFLAGS`. On x86_64:
   - If it’s a **system call** returning via **`SYSRET`** or **`syscall return stub`** (in Linux, e.g. `ret_from_syscall`), it might:
     - Move the saved user `RIP` from wherever it was stored (e.g., the kernel stack memory offset) back into `RCX`.
     - Move the saved user `RFLAGS` into `R11`.
     - Execute **`SYSRET`** which will pop those from `RCX`/`R11`.  
   - If it’s an **interrupt** returning via **`IRETQ`**:
     - The CPU expects the user `RIP`, `CS`, `RFLAGS`, (optionally `SS`, `RSP`) to be on top of the stack.
     - The instruction `IRETQ` (or `IRET`) will pop them atomically and return to user mode.  
4. **Stack pointer** is reloaded:
   - If returning to user mode, `%RSP` must be set to the user stack pointer. For interrupts, it was saved on the kernel stack so the kernel code ensures that’s placed back on the kernel stack in the correct sequence so that an `IRETQ` sees it.

### 7.1 Handling Interrupts

- **`IRETQ`** will pop `RIP`, `CS`, `RFLAGS`, and if ring changes from 0 to 3, also pop `SS` and `RSP`.  
- The kernel sets those fields on the kernel stack so that when `IRETQ` runs, it transitions gracefully to user mode at the correct address.

### 7.2 Race Conditions & Interrupt Enable

- In principle, interrupts can arrive again while you’re restoring. But that’s less problematic than while saving, because the old user state is already in memory.  
- The kernel typically only re-enables interrupts near the end of system call handling or after scheduling decisions are made.

---

## 8. Critical Observations & Edge Cases

**Timestamp ~11:34 →**  

1. **Disabling interrupts** is crucial during the initial saving of state. If an interrupt arrives in the middle of partial save, it could override registers or push onto the same stack, corrupting data.
2. **Interrupt Stack**: On many modern x86_64 OSes, interrupts often switch to a dedicated **interrupt stack** (via the IST mechanism in the TSS). This further prevents collisions with the kernel stack used for system calls if the kernel stack is compromised or already deeply nested.
3. **Returning to user mode** does not require disabling interrupts for the entire restore process. If an interrupt arrives mid-restore, the interrupt handler has a separate stack, so the partial kernel stack used for returning to user mode remains consistent.

---

## 9. Additional Context in Thread Structures

**Timestamp ~13:50 →**  

Besides the core registers, each **thread** (or process) might have additional context to store:

- **Thread-Local Storage** (TLS) segments or pointers
- **IO/FP State** (e.g., AVX registers) or floating-point environment
- **Debug registers** or other special CPU contexts

In Linux, these might be stored in the **`thread_info`** or **`task_struct`**. On Windows, they go in **`KTHREAD`**. The exact layout depends on the OS. At context switch time, the kernel might choose to lazily or eagerly save/restore these depending on performance constraints.

---

## 10. Leveraging Kernel Entry for Scheduling

**Timestamp ~19:01 →**  

When the CPU transitions from user to kernel (via a system call or interrupt), the kernel can decide **not** to return to the same user process right away:

1. The kernel can do other tasks, run a different kernel thread, or schedule a different user process.
2. In Linux, for example, the final steps of system call handling might call `schedule()` which picks a new thread to run. If a new process is picked, that triggers a **full process context switch** (including TLB flush).
3. If the same process remains or a thread in the same process is chosen, the cost is lower.

So, **entering the kernel** is an opportunity for the OS to do housekeeping:  
- Check if the current thread’s time slice expired  
- Check if there’s a higher priority task waiting  
- Possibly context-switch to something else.

## 11. Code Snippets & Visualizations

### 11.1 Simplified Assembly for System Call Entry

```asm
; Hypothetical x86_64 system call entry routine (pseudo-assembly)

global entry_SYSCALL_64
entry_SYSCALL_64:
    swapgs             ; swap user gsbase with kernel gsbase if needed
    pushq %rdi         ; example: push some registers
    pushq %rsi
    ...
    movq  %rcx, -8(%rsp)  ; store user RIP
    movq  %r11, -16(%rsp) ; store user RFLAGS
    ...
    ; Disable interrupts to avoid partial state corruption
    cli
    ; Switch stack pointer if needed, e.g. from TSS->RSP0
    ; do rest of context save, push all regs
    ...
    ; re-enable interrupts if safe
    sti
    call handle_syscall ; jump to C function

    ; eventually return by reversing
````

In reality, Linux uses macros like **`SAVE_EXTRA_REGS`**, **`SWITCH_TO_KERNEL_CR3`** (for PTI), etc., but the concept is similar.

### 11.2 Returning from a System Call

```asm
; Pseudocode for returning from syscall
ret_from_syscall:
    ; Possibly call schedule() if needed
    ; Restore registers from stack
    ; Move user RIP into rcx, user RFLAGS into r11
    swapgs
    sysretq
```

**`sysretq`** returns to user mode, using `rcx` for RIP and `r11` for EFLAGS. It has some restrictions (like the `RIP` must be in canonical form).

### 11.3 Interrupt Return Diagram (IRETQ)

```plaintext
Kernel Stack (after interrupt):
   +---------------------+  <- RSP
   |  user RFLAGS       |
   +---------------------+
   |  user CS           |
   +---------------------+
   |  user RIP          |
   +---------------------+
   |  other saved regs  |
   +---------------------+
        ...
IRETQ => pops user RIP, CS, RFLAGS (and SS, RSP if ring change)
```

When the kernel code executes `iretq`, the CPU will pop the instruction pointer & flags, re-enter user mode, and continue where the interrupt left off.

---

## 12. Summary of Key Points

1. **System calls** (planned) vs. **interrupts** (unplanned):
    
    - **System call** uses `rcx`, `r11` to store return IP & flags.
        
    - **Interrupt** pushes IP & flags onto the stack automatically.
        
2. **Stack pointer** switching:
    
    - The OS uses the **TSS** to find a suitable kernel stack pointer, especially when crossing from user→kernel.
        
    - The old user `%RSP` must be temporarily stored so the OS can restore it later if it returns to user mode.
        
3. **Context saving** must be **atomic**:
    
    - Typically done with interrupts disabled for a brief time to avoid partial save corruption.
        
4. **Context restoration** is reversed:
    
    - `IRETQ` or `SYSRETQ` is used to pop or set the IP/flags, returning to user mode.
        
    - Interrupts can arrive mid-restore without catastrophic issues because the OS stack usage is carefully managed.
        
5. **After entering kernel**:
    
    - The OS can decide to schedule a **different** thread/process or do the same. The trap into kernel mode is effectively an opportunity to run the scheduler.

## 13. Final Takeaways

- **Instruction Pointer**, **Flags**, and **Stack Pointer** are the **primary citizens** that must be handled very carefully during ring transitions.
    
- **x86_64** uses different mechanics (`SYSCALL/SYSRET` vs. `INT/IRETQ`) depending on planned or unplanned events.
    
- This design allows the kernel to handle asynchronous events (interrupts) reliably, plus synchronous user requests (system calls) with minimal overhead.
    
- The general pattern: user→kernel, save state, do kernel tasks, possibly schedule, restore or switch context, and eventually return (with new or same thread).
