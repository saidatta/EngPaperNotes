Below is a set of **detailed Obsidian-style notes** covering the second half of the lecture on **Context Switch Details-II**from Professor Smruti R. Sarangi’s Operating Systems series. These notes assume background from previous sections of the lecture, including the process of saving/restoring CPU state and the nuances of user→kernel transitions. We focus on the kernel’s _context switch_ function, memory structure switching (page tables, TLB flush), and relevant kernel coding conventions in C.

**Lecture:** Operating Systems (Smruti R. Sarangi)  
**Topic:** Continuing deep dive into context switching details, especially regarding how Linux (and similar OSes) manages switching from one task to another in the kernel.

## 1. Recap & Setting

**Timestamp ~21:10 →**  

Previously, we explored how a system call or interrupt **enters** the kernel, how crucial CPU registers are saved, and how the system eventually **returns** to user mode. **Context switching** expands on that: once the kernel has control, it can decide to continue the same process or switch to another, possibly higher-priority, process or thread.

### Why Switch?

- **Fairness and Scheduling**: Even if a user process triggers a system call or an interrupt arrives while it’s running, the kernel may decide (for fairness or priority reasons) to schedule another process/thread.  
- **Internal Kernel Work**: The kernel might choose to run its own threads (e.g., kernel daemons) before returning to user mode.

---

## 2. The Run Queue and Scheduling

### 2.1 The Run Queue (`runqueue` or `rq`)

- In Linux and similar OSes, a **run queue** is a data structure tracking ready tasks (threads).  
- When a scheduling event occurs (interrupt, system call completion, time slice expiry, etc.), the scheduler picks the **next task** to run.  
- If the **previous task** is different from the **next task**, a **context switch** ensues.

### 2.2 The Context Switch Function

1. **`prepare_task_switch()`**  
   - Notifies the **previous task** (the one currently running) that it will be switched out.  
   - For instance, it may set the previous task’s state to “not running” or “ready” depending on the reason.

2. **`__switch_to(prev, next)`**  
   - An **architecture-specific** function that handles the low-level context switch details (registers, stack pointers, possibly TLB or CR3 changes).  
   - On x86, you might see `_switch_to` or `__switch_to` in `arch/x86/kernel/switch_to.S`.

3. **`finish_task_switch(next)`**  
   - Marks the **next task** as “running.”  
   - Updates other kernel structures (e.g. `current` pointer, which references the thread currently on the CPU).
   - Potentially does small housekeeping like `kmap`/`kunmap` balancing, final user-mode return (via `IRETQ` or `SYSCALL` return).

> **Note**: Some of these names vary; the steps remain conceptually similar in other OSes.

## 3. Memory Structure Switching (mm_struct / active_mm)

**Timestamp ~24:00 →**  

In Linux, each **process** has a data structure describing its memory layout: **`mm_struct`**. This includes:

- The root of the page-table (on x86_64, PML4).  
- A list or tree of virtual memory areas (VMAs).  
- Other memory accounting info.

### 3.1 The `mm` and `active_mm` Pointers

Each `task_struct` has two fields relevant to address spaces:

- **`mm`**: The process’s own memory descriptor (non-null for normal user processes).  
- **`active_mm`**: The address space the thread is *actively* using.  

#### Why `active_mm`?

1. **User Process**:  
   - `mm == active_mm`  
   - The thread’s own user address space is active.

2. **Pure Kernel Thread**:  
   - `mm == NULL` (because pure kernel threads do not have an associated user address space).  
   - However, `active_mm` often points to the last user space that was running on that CPU. This can be relevant if the kernel thread temporarily needs access to that address space or for page table references.  

Hence, a kernel thread effectively “borrows” the `active_mm` from the last user process on that CPU if it needs to reference user space. Or it just keeps the existing CR3 loaded (the old user’s page table) if no flush is needed.

### 3.2 Example Kernel Code Snippets

```c
if (next->mm == NULL) {
    // next is a pure kernel thread
    next->active_mm = prev->active_mm;
    // Possibly increment reference count on that mm if needed
    // ...
} else {
    // next->mm != NULL means it's a user thread
    next->active_mm = next->mm;
}
````

- This logic ensures that a kernel thread still has a valid `active_mm` for referencing page tables if needed.
    

**Switching from or to a kernel thread**:

- If **previous** was a kernel-only thread, we may set `prev->active_mm = NULL` if it’s no longer relevant.
    
- If **next** is a user thread, we load `CR3` with its `mm->pgd` base (page directory). If it differs from `prev->active_mm->pgd`, we flush TLB.
    

### 3.3 When the Scheduler Switches to a Different User Process

- If `prev->mm != next->mm`, the OS calls something like `switch_mm(prev->active_mm, next->mm, cpu)`, which:
    
    1. Updates CR3 to `next->mm->pgd` (or `DirectoryTableBase` on x86).
        
    2. Flushes the TLB or uses PCID/ASID logic if supported.
        
- This is the most expensive scenario because a full address space switch (and TLB flush) is needed.

## 4. The Full Switch Sequence

**Timestamp ~31:00 →**

### 4.1 Inside the `switch_to(prev, next)` Macro/Function

Conceptually:

1. **Switch Memory Context** (if needed):
    
    - If `next->mm != prev->mm`, call `switch_mm`.
        
    - If `next->mm == NULL`, keep the old `active_mm` or set it accordingly.
        
2. **Save/Restore Kernel-Mode Registers**:
    
    - General-purpose registers, segment registers, debug registers, floating-point/SIMD state (unless using lazy fpu context).
        
    - On x86, done via assembly in `_switch_to` or a combination of inline assembly/C macros.
        
3. **Change `current` pointer**:
    
    - Something like `current = next`. Usually stored in the per-CPU variable or on the stack.
        
4. **Finish**:
    
    - Mark `prev->state = TASK_RUNNING` (or WAITING) if not already done.
        
    - Mark `next->state = TASK_RUNNING`.
        
    - If the kernel is about to return to user mode, it might do that final jump via `IRETQ` or `sysret`. Otherwise, continue in kernel mode.
        

### 4.2 The Final `finish_task_switch`

- Could update scheduler stats (like context switch counters, CPU usage).
    
- `kmap`/`kunmap` operations on 32-bit systems if kernel memory is partially mapped (less relevant on 64-bit).
    
- Possibly calls `schedule_tail()` if the newly switched task needs extra setup (like a freshly forked thread returning in kernel mode).

## 5. C Visibility & Kernel Coding Conventions

**Timestamp ~32:00 →**

### 5.1 Global vs. Static Functions

In Linux kernel C:

- Prefixing a function with **`static`** restricts its visibility to the current `.c` file. It’s the kernel’s main form of “private” function.
    
- You might see functions with double underscores, e.g., **`__switch_to`**, which conventionally indicates they are **internal** or “low-level”– but the underscores themselves do not enforce visibility. Usually, they’re also declared `static` or in a header as an internal symbol.
    

### 5.2 Macros: `likely()` and `unlikely()`

- **`likely(condition)`** / **`unlikely(condition)`**: Hints to the compiler’s branch predictor that the condition is (un)likely true.
    
- The kernel uses this to optimize critical paths. For example:
    
    ```c
    if (likely(task->state == TASK_RUNNING)) {
        // fast path
    } else {
        // slow path
    }
    ```
    
- Under the hood, these expand to **GCC/Clang builtins** like `__builtin_expect`.
    

### 5.3 `latent_entropy`

- A technique where the kernel uses seemingly random aspects of runtime (pointer addresses, scheduling timings) as **entropy** for cryptographic or randomness pools.
    
- Marked in code with macros like `latent_entropy` to feed the kernel’s random subsystem.

## 6. Wrapping Up Context Switching

**Timestamp ~39:02 →**

### 6.1 Summary of This Chapter

1. **Processes and `task_struct`**: We introduced the basic concept of a process and the `task_struct`.
    
2. **Process Creation**: `fork()` mechanics, copy-on-write, linking new tasks into the scheduler.
    
3. **Context Switch**:
    
    - **TLB/page-table** flush logic: only flush if we switch to a different address space.
        
    - **Saving/Restoring** critical CPU state (IP, flags, stack pointer) for both **system calls** (planned) and **interrupts**(unplanned).
        
    - **`mm_struct`** vs **`active_mm`** for kernel threads vs user processes.
        
    - Steps to switch registers, stack, and memory context, plus final `IRETQ` or `SYSRET`.
        

### 6.2 Next Topics

- **Chapter 4**: **Communication Mechanisms** (system calls, interrupts, exceptions, signals) – now that we have created and can switch among processes, we explore how user processes communicate with the kernel and vice versa:
    
    - **System Calls**: user→kernel calls.
        
    - **Exceptions**: CPU-detected errors.
        
    - **Interrupts**: hardware or timer-driven events.
        
    - **Signals**: kernel→user notifications.
        

**End of Chapter**. The fundamental ideas of context switching (both the saving/restoring steps and the scheduling decisions) are now clear. Next, we will see how processes actually talk to the kernel and to each other.

## 7. Code & Visualization Examples

### 7.1 Switch to a Kernel Thread

```c
// Simplified pseudo-code
// switching from prev (user) to next (kernel thread)
void context_switch(task_struct *prev, task_struct *next) {
    if (next->mm == NULL) {
        // next is a pure kernel thread
        next->active_mm = prev->active_mm;
        atomic_inc(&prev->active_mm->mm_count); 
    }
    else {
        next->active_mm = next->mm;
    }

    // Possibly flush TLB if next->mm != prev->mm
    switch_mm(prev->active_mm, next->active_mm, cpu_id);

    // Architecture-specific register save/restore
    __switch_to(prev, next);

    // finish
    finish_task_switch(next);
}
```

### 7.2 Diagram: Task’s `mm` and `active_mm`

```plaintext
+-------------------+       +-------------------+
|  Kernel Thread A  |       |   User Process B  |
+-------------------+       +-------------------+
| mm = NULL         |  -->  | mm = active_mm --> (Describes user address space)
| active_mm = ???   |       | active_mm = mm
+-------------------+       +-------------------+

Scenario:
1) If Thread A started after B did a syscall, A's active_mm = B->mm
   (So A can still reference B's address space for certain ops).
2) If switching to another user process C,
   we do switch_mm(...) from B->mm to C->mm, flush TLB, etc.
```

## 8. Key Takeaways

1. **Minimize TLB flushes** – Switch the page table only if moving to a different user address space.
    
2. **Kernel threads** share a global kernel mapping, no separate `mm_struct`. They borrow `active_mm` from the last user process.
    
3. **Detailed steps** in context switch:
    
    1. Save CPU registers (including EIP/RIP, RFLAGS, RSP)
        
    2. Possibly flush TLB / load new CR3
        
    3. Restore new thread’s registers & set `current = next`
        
    4. Return in kernel or user context (IRETQ / sysret).
        
4. **Linux kernel** has many internal conventions: `_switch_to`, `likely()`, `unlikely()`, `_ _` prefix, `latent_entropy`macros, etc.
    

**With that,** we conclude the deeper exploration of **context switching**. Next step is to explore **communication**mechanisms like **system calls**, **exceptions**, **interrupts**, and **signals** in greater depth.
