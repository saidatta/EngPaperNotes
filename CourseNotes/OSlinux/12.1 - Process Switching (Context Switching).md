## 1. Introduction

**Timestamp: 0:32**
- This lecture focuses on how the operating system switches processes (a.k.a. _context switches_).  
- It is more complex than it may initially appear.  
- We discuss both **hardware context** and **software context** of a process.
### 1.1 Hardware vs Software Context

- **Hardware Context**:
  - General-purpose registers (e.g., `RAX`, `RBX`, `RCX`, etc. on x86_64)
  - Program Counter (PC) or **Instruction Pointer (IP)** on x86
  - Segment registers (e.g., `FS`, `GS`, sometimes `CS`, `DS`, `ES`, `SS` in x86_64)
  - Privileged registers:
    - Example: `CR3`, which stores the base address of the page table
  - Condition flags / floating-point flags
    - E.g., in x86: `EFLAGS` register, storing flags like Zero Flag (ZF), Carry Flag (CF), etc.
- **Software Context**:
  - Open files, network connections
  - Any OS resource usage accounting: how long the process has run, scheduling priority
  - The process’s **address space** (though part of it is associated with the hardware concept of page tables, the software perspective is the structure in the OS)
  - This info is usually in the OS’s task structure (e.g., **`task_struct`** in Linux)

> **Key point**: Hardware context **must** be saved/restored carefully whenever switching out/in a process. Software context remains in OS data structures (e.g., kernel’s PCB or task_struct) and is updated less dynamically.

## 2. Page Table and TLB Considerations

**Timestamp: 1:53 - 4:06**  

- **Page Table**: Ties virtual addresses to physical addresses.  
- **TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer)**: A cache of virtual-to-physical address translations.  
- Changing `CR3` (the page-table base register on x86) forces a TLB flush:
  - This is **very expensive** because all TLB entries become invalid when you change the page table root.
  - Leads to many TLB misses afterward, degrading performance significantly.
- **Goal**: Minimize changing `CR3` (i.e., do not switch page tables too often) to reduce TLB flush overhead.
---
## 3. Types of Context Switches

**Timestamp: 4:06 - 6:00**
We have four primary “paths” or transitions to consider. Label them:
1. **User → Kernel (U2K)**
2. **Kernel → Kernel (K2K)**
3. **Kernel → User (K2U)**:
   - **3a**: Returning to the **same** user process
   - **3b**: Switching to a **different** user process

> **Note**: There is no direct **User → User** transition without going through the kernel.
### 3.1 Why Distinguish These Cases?
- Flushing the TLB and changing `CR3` is expensive. So, if the kernel can avoid it, it should.
- **Kernel threads** all share the same kernel address space and thus typically do not require a full address space switch (and TLB flush).
---
## 4. Kernel Threads and Shared Kernel Address Space
**Timestamp: 6:00 - 9:08**
1. All **kernel threads** share the same virtual address space in the kernel region.  
2. The virtual address space is **split** between:
   - **User space (lower part)**  
   - **Kernel space (upper part)**  
![[Screenshot 2025-05-06 at 9.43.36 AM.png]]
**Example**: 32-bit x86 might have a 3GB (user) / 1GB (kernel) split, or Windows might use 2GB/2GB.  
In 64-bit systems, the split is conceptually similar but with a much larger address space.
- The **kernel space mapping** (upper portion) is **identical** for all processes or threads:
  - The same kernel virtual address in different processes usually maps to the **same physical address**.  
- The **user space mapping** (lower portion) differs from process to process.
### 4.1 Implication for TLB Flushing
- If we switch from user to kernel, we can **reuse** the same page-table structure for the kernel part (the top region).  
- If a process is in kernel mode (system call), it is using kernel addresses, but the high-level mapping is the same across all processes for that kernel region.  
  - So we **do not** need to flush the TLB for the kernel region.  
  - The user region may be irrelevant while in pure kernel mode.

---
## 5. PID Tags in TLB Entries (Address-Space Identifier)

**Timestamp: 9:08 - 10:38**
- One solution to avoid TLB flushes on context switches is to store a **Process Identifier (PID)** (or **Address Space Identifier**, ASID) along with each TLB entry.
  - Then the TLB can differentiate entries from different processes, avoiding a global flush when `CR3` is changed.
  - x86 (Intel) does have features like **PCID** (Process-Context Identifier) in newer generations.
- **Downside**: This is a hardware-level feature that includes software-level process ID concepts. It slightly breaks the layering principle (hardware vs. OS). But practically, it significantly improves performance.

> If the hardware **does not** support ASIDs/PCIDs, we **must flush** the TLB on every switch to a different process.  

---

## 6. Minimizing TLB Flushes

**Timestamp: 10:38 - 16:00**
- **User → Kernel** transition (U2K): **No need** to flush TLB or change page table:
  1. The kernel code address range is the same across all processes.
  2. The user’s page-table structure is *already* set for that user process.  
  3. We simply switch CPU mode to ring 0 (kernel mode), possibly switch to a **kernel stack**, but do not blow away TLB entries.
- **Kernel → Kernel** (K2K) transition:
  1. Switching among kernel threads: same kernel address mapping is used.
  2. Again, **no TLB flush** and **no `CR3` reload** is needed if the OS uses the same kernel page table.  
- **Kernel → User** (K2U):
  - 3a. If returning to the **same** user process, we keep using that process’s page table.  
    - **No TLB flush** needed (the kernel part remains the same, user part is the same process’s memory).
  - 3b. If returning to a **different** user process, we must:
    - **Flush TLB** (or at least flush all user-space entries if we do not have ASIDs).
    - **Reload `CR3`** with the new process’s page-table base.  
### 6.1 Scheduler Optimization Insight
- **Expensive** operation: switching to a different user process, because it **invalidates** TLB and sets `CR3` to a different page table base.
- If possible, the scheduler tries to keep running the **same** process after a kernel call or interrupt to avoid TLB flush overhead.  
- If it must switch processes, that’s when the overhead occurs.

## 7. Visualization: Virtual Address Spaces

**Timestamp: 13:00 - 16:00**  

```plaintext
+------------------------+  <- High Addresses (e.g., 0xFFFFFFFF for 32-bit)
|   Kernel Space         |  (same mapping for all processes / threads)
|------------------------|  <- boundary (e.g. 0xC0000000 or 0x80000000)
|   User Space           |  (unique to each process)
+------------------------+  <- Low Addresses (0x0)
````

- **Kernel threads**: Only the top region (kernel space) is relevant for them.
    
- **User processes**: Have a lower region mapped to their own code, data, stack, heap, etc. plus the same upper region for the kernel.

---
## 8. Code & Conceptual Examples

### 8.1 Example: Minimal Assembly for Changing `CR3`

Below is a conceptual snippet (not real user-level code) illustrating how the OS might switch page tables in x86:

```asm
; Assume new_page_table_base is in register RAX (64-bit)

mov    CR3, RAX         ; This changes the page-table base
; TLB automatically gets flushed upon writing to CR3
```

- After this instruction:
    
    - All TLB entries are effectively invalid (some architectures may preserve kernel entries if PCIDs are used).
        
    - Next memory accesses must repopulate TLB entries.
        

### 8.2 High-Level Kernel Pseudocode for Context Switch

```c
// Pseudocode for a context switch routine in a kernel scheduler

void context_switch(task_struct* prev, task_struct* next) {
    // 1. If prev == next, no switch needed
    if (prev == next) return;

    // 2. Save prev task's hardware context (registers, CPU state)
    save_state(prev);

    // 3. Switch to new address space if next is a different user process
    if (next->mm != prev->mm) { 
        // mm: memory descriptor/pointer to page-table struct
        load_cr3(next->mm->pgd_base);
        flush_tlb();  // If no ASID/PCID support
    }

    // 4. Load next task's hardware context
    load_state(next);

    // 5. Set CPU to run next
    switch_to(next);
}
```

> Real kernels (e.g., Linux) have more intricate logic, but the essential steps are:
> 
> - Save the old context
>     
> - Possibly change page tables
>     
> - Restore the new context
### 8.3 Scheduling Example

```plaintext
User Process A (in user space) -> system call -> 
    Kernel code executes -> 
        decides to schedule a different kernel thread KThreadX
        (No TLB flush, no CR3 change) ->
            KThreadX finishes -> schedule() -> 
                decides to go back to A's user space 
                or maybe to user Process B

If it goes back to A: 
   => same address space, no flush

If it goes to B:
   => new CR3, TLB flush
```

## 9. Summary of Key Points

1. **Hardware Context** must be carefully saved and restored.
    
2. **Software Context** remains in kernel structures (e.g., `task_struct`) and doesn't require special CPU instructions to handle.
    
3. **Changing `CR3`** => TLB flush => Expensive.
    
4. **No need** to flush TLB or reload page tables for:
    
    - User → Kernel transitions
        
    - Kernel → Kernel thread transitions
        
    - Kernel → same user process transitions
        
5. **Must** flush TLB (or at least user entries) and reload page tables for:
    
    - Kernel → different user process transitions (K2U with a different process)

## 10. Additional Notes & Advanced Topics

- **PCID / ASID**:
    
    - Modern Intel processors support **PCID**.
        
    - Some RISC architectures (MIPS, RISC-V, ARM) use an **ASID** field in TLB entries.
        
    - If these are utilized, context switches between user processes might not require a full TLB flush, only partial invalidation of stale entries.
        
- **Security**:
    
    - Some architectures isolate the kernel entirely (e.g., KPTI for Meltdown/Spectre mitigation on x86_64) so that user processes use a separate mapping without the kernel region. This changes the dynamic somewhat but the fundamental principle of TLB flush on switching to a different user address space remains.
        
- **Large Virtual Address Space** (64-bit):
    
    - Minimizes collisions in TLB but the conceptual approach stays the same.

## 11. Quick Reference

- **`CR3` register**: x86 register for page-table base address.
    
- **`mov CR3, ...`**: triggers TLB flush.
    
- **TLB**: cache of (VPN → PPN) translations to speed up virtual memory lookups.
    
- **K2K** and **U2K** transitions**: no TLB flush needed if we stay in the same page-table structure.
    
- **Scheduler**: tries to minimize context switches that require TLB flushes (i.e., tries to run the same process again if possible).

## 12. Diagram Recap

```plaintext
Case 1: User (Proc A) -> Kernel
   - No flush, same CR3

Case 2: Kernel -> Kernel (Thread X -> Thread Y)
   - No flush, same kernel mapping

Case 3a: Kernel -> same User (Proc A)
   - No flush, same CR3

Case 3b: Kernel -> different User (Proc A -> Proc B)
   - Flush TLB, reload CR3 with B’s page table
```

**Performance tip**: Minimizing the frequency of **Case 3b** transitions is crucial for system performance.
