- **Decrease Key:** \( O(\log n) \) time complexity.
- **Building Heaps:** Linear time for binary and Fibonacci heaps, \( O(n \log n) \) for balanced binary search trees.
#### Binomial Trees
- **Definition and Structure:**
  - Recursive definition: \( B_0 \) is a single node; \( B_k \) is formed by linking two \( B_{k-1} \) trees.
  - \( B_k \) tree: One tree becomes the child of the other's root.
- **Properties:**
  - \( B_k \) has \( 2^k \) nodes.
  - Height of \( B_k \): \( k \).
  - Nodes at level \( i \) of \( B_k \): \( \binom{k}{i} \) (binomial coefficient).
  - Root of \( B_k \) has degree \( k \); children's degrees are \( k-1 \) down to 0.
- **Example:** \( B_3 \) tree analysis with 8 nodes, height 3, and root degree 3.
#### Mathematical Insights
- **Node Count Formula:** \( 2^k \) nodes in \( B_k \).
- **Height Analysis:** Height of \( B_k \) is \( k \).
- **Level-wise Node Count:** \( \binom{k}{i} \) nodes at level \( i \).
- **Degree of Nodes:** Root has degree \( k \); children have decreasing degrees.
- **Proof:** Inductive proof based on the recursive structure of binomial trees.
#### Binomial Heap Structure
- **Definition:** A binomial heap is a collection of binomial trees that satisfy the min-heap property.
- **Heap Property:** Each tree in the heap is a min-heap.
- **Degree Constraint:** No two trees in the heap have the same degree.
- **Maximum Degree:** In a heap with \( n \) nodes, the maximum degree is \( \log n \).
#### Operations on Binomial Heaps
- **Merge (Union) Operation:**
  - Combine two binomial heaps.
  - Merge trees of the same degree.
- **Insertion:**
  - Create a new tree \( B_0 \) and merge it with the existing heap.
- **Delete Minimum:**
  - Find the tree with the minimum root.
  - Remove this tree and merge its children back into the heap.
- **Decrease Key:**

  - If heap property is violated, traverse up the tree to fix it.
#### Code Snippets
- **Insertion Pseudocode:**
  ```python
  def insert(heap, value):
      new_heap = make_binomial_heap_with_single_node(value)
      return merge_heaps(heap, new_heap)
  ```

- **Merge Heaps Pseudocode:**
  ```python
  def merge_heaps(heap1, heap2):
      # Combine the root lists of both heaps
      # Ensure no two trees have the same degree
      # Adjust pointers to maintain min-heap property
  ```

#### Conclusion and Insights
- **Efficiency in Merging:** Binomial heaps are superior to binary heaps for merge operations.
- **Step Towards Fibonacci Heaps:** Binomial heaps are a foundational concept leading to the understanding of Fibonacci heaps.

Creating detailed Obsidian notes for the "Binomial Heaps (part 2/3): Amortized Analysis of Insert" lecture in Advanced Algorithms can help you grasp the complexities of this data structure's performance. Here's how to structure your notes:

### Amortized Analysis of Binomial Heaps

#### Recap: Amortized Analysis
- **Purpose:** To understand the average time over a sequence of operations rather than the worst case for each operation.
- **Methods:** 
  - **Accounting Method:** Assigns a hypothetical "cost" (coins) to operations. Ensures the total assigned cost covers the actual cost.
  - **Potential Method:** Uses a "potential function" to measure the stored energy (potential) in the data structure, which helps pay for expensive operations.

#### Binary Counter Example
- **Operation:** Incrementing a binary counter.
- **Cost:** Varies based on the number of bits flipped.
- **Amortized Analysis:**
  - Using the accounting method, each increment operation is assigned a cost of 2 coins.
  - Using the potential method, the potential is defined as the number of 1 bits in the counter.
  - Both methods conclude that the amortized cost of incrementing a binary counter is constant, despite the actual cost varying.

#### Binomial Heaps Analysis
- **Accounting Method for Binomial Heaps:**
  - **Objective:** Save one coin for every tree in a binomial heap.
  - **Make Zero (Create Empty Heap):** Amortized cost is set to 1 (constant time operation, no coins needed).
  - **Linking Trees:** Amortized cost is 0, as coins from trees are used for linking.
  - **Insert:** Amortized cost of 3. Requires 1 coin for creating a singleton heap, 1 coin for saving with the new tree, and 1 coin for calling union.
  - **Union (Merging Two Heaps):** Involves merging root lists and linking trees of the same degree. Amortized cost is \( O(\log n) \).
  - **Delete Min:** Involves removing a node, merging children with the remaining heap, and then performing union. Amortized cost is \( O(\log n) \).

#### Conclusion of Amortized Analysis using Accounting Method
- **Findings:** 
  - All operations in binomial heaps can be performed in \( O(\log n) \) amortized time.
  - Insert operation, in particular, has a constant amortized time, which is an improvement over the worst-case analysis.

Creating detailed Obsidian notes for the "Binomial Heaps (part 2/3): Amortized Analysis of Insert" lecture in Advanced Algorithms will enhance your understanding of the performance of binomial heaps, particularly for the insert operation. Here's how you can structure your notes:

### Amortized Analysis of Binomial Heaps using the Potential Method

#### Overview of the Potential Method
- **Definition:** A technique used in amortized analysis where a potential function measures the 'stored energy' in a data structure.
- **Application:** This 'potential' or 'stored energy' is used to account for the cost of operations over time, rather than analyzing each operation in isolation.

#### Potential Function for Binomial Heaps
- **Formulation:** \( \Phi = C \times \text{number of trees in the heap} \), where \( C \) is a constant â‰¥ 1.
- **Initial Potential:** Zero, as there are no trees initially.
- **Non-Negativity:** The number of trees is always non-negative, ensuring the potential never decreases below the initial value.

#### Amortized Cost Calculation
- **General Formula:** Amortized cost of an operation = Actual cost + Change in potential.
- **Operations Analysis:**
  - **Make Zero (Create Empty Heap):** 
    - Actual Cost = 1 (constant time to create an empty heap).
    - Change in Potential = 0 (no trees created).
    - Amortized Cost = 1.
  - **Linking Trees:**
    - Actual Cost = 1 (cost to link two trees).
    - Change in Potential = -C (one less tree after linking).
    - Amortized Cost â‰¤ 0 (since C â‰¥ 1).
  - **Make One (Create Singleton Heap):**
    - Actual Cost = 1.
    - Change in Potential = C (one new tree created).
    - Amortized Cost = 1 + C (constant as C is a constant).

#### Amortized Analysis of Insert Operation
- **Process:**
  - Create a heap of size one and then link trees as needed.
  - Actual Cost = 1 (initialization) + K (number of linking steps).
- **Change in Potential:**
  - +C for the new tree.
  - -C(K-1) for K-1 trees removed by linking.
- **Amortized Cost Calculation:**
  - Amortized Cost = 1 + K + C - C(K-1).
  - Simplified to a constant term (since C is constant).

#### Analysis of Other Operations
- **Union Operation:**
  - Actual Cost = K + L (where K, L are in \( O(\log n) \)).
  - Change in Potential = -C * L (trees reduced by linking).
  - Amortized Cost = \( O(\log n) \).
- **Delete Min Operation:**
  - Involves removing the minimum, union operation, and updating the minimum pointer.
  - Amortized Cost also results in \( O(\log n) \).

#### Conclusion
- **Insert Operation:** Demonstrated to have constant amortized time using the potential method.
- **Other Operations:** Maintain their respective amortized time complexities.
- **Implications:** This analysis shows the efficiency of binomial heaps, especially for the insert operation.

### Binomial Heaps with Lazy Union Operation

#### Introduction to Lazy Union
- **Motivation:** To achieve a constant time complexity for the union operation in binomial heaps.
- **Traditional Union vs. Lazy Union:**
  - Traditional Union: Merges two heaps by building a proper binomial heap structure.
  - Lazy Union: Simply concatenates the root lists of two heaps without restructuring.

#### Implementation of Lazy Union
- **List Concatenation:** Root lists of the heaps are concatenated, leading to a potential deviation from the standard binomial heap structure.
- **Deferred Restructuring:** The restructuring into a proper binomial heap is delayed until necessary, such as during the delete-min operation.
- **Advantages:** Reduces the immediate work required to maintain the heap structure, especially beneficial in scenarios with frequent union operations.

#### Operations with Lazy Union
- **Make Zero (Create Empty Heap):** Same as before.
- **Linking Trees:** Same as before.
- **Union Operation:** 
  - Concatenates the lists of two heaps.
  - Updates the minimum pointer to point to the smallest key of the two minima.
- **Insert Operation:** 
  - Creates a heap of size one with the new element and performs a lazy union with the existing heap.
- **Delete Min Operation:** 
  - Removes the minimum element.
  - Reconstructs a proper binomial heap from the remaining elements.

#### Example: Lazy Union in Action
- **Insertions:** Inserting elements one by one results in a simple concatenated list rather than a structured binomial heap.
- **Delete Min:** 
  - Finds the minimum quickly but then needs to rebuild the heap structure.
  - Involves creating an array for tree placement based on their degrees and then linking trees as necessary.

#### Detailed Example of Delete Min Operation
- **Array Creation:** Based on the degrees of the trees, an array of size \( \log n + 1 \) is created.
- **Tree Placement and Linking:** 
  - Trees are placed in the array according to their degree.
  - When a conflict occurs (two trees of the same degree), they are linked, and the resulting tree is placed in the next higher degree slot.

#### Amortized Analysis of Lazy Union
- **Accounting Method and Potential Method:** 
  - Both methods can be used to analyze the amortized cost of operations under the lazy union approach.
  - The idea is to account for the cost of operations over a sequence of actions rather than individually.

#### Conclusion
- **Efficiency Gain:** The lazy union approach allows for constant time union operations, significantly improving efficiency in certain use cases.
- **Trade-Off:** While union operations become cheaper, delete-min operations may become more expensive due to the need to rebuild the heap.
- **Amortized Performance:** Despite the potential increase in cost for delete-min, the overall amortized cost of operations remains efficient.

---
#### Introduction to Lazy Union in Binomial Heaps
- **Motivation:** Achieving faster union operations (constant time) in binomial heaps.
- **Traditional vs. Lazy Union:**
  - Traditional Union: Merges two heaps by building a proper binomial heap structure, taking \(O(\log n)\) time.
  - Lazy Union: Concatenates the root lists of two heaps without immediate restructuring, aiming for \(O(1)\) time.

#### Implementation Details
- **Concatenation of Root Lists:** In lazy union, the root lists of the heaps are concatenated, resulting in a list that might not conform to the binomial heap structure.
- **Deferred Restructuring:** Proper restructuring into a binomial heap is delayed until necessary, typically during the delete-min operation.
- **Advantages:** Reduces the work required to maintain the binomial heap structure, particularly beneficial for frequent union operations.

#### Key Operations with Lazy Union
- **Make Zero (Create Empty Heap):** Unchanged from the standard implementation.
- **Linking Trees:** Unchanged from the standard implementation.
- **Union Operation:**
  - Concatenates the lists of two heaps.
  - Updates the minimum pointer to the smaller of the two heap minima.
- **Insert Operation:**
  - Creates a singleton heap with the new element and performs a lazy union.
- **Delete Min Operation:**
  - Removes the minimum element.
  - Reconstructs a proper binomial heap from the remaining elements.

#### Analyzing Lazy Union with the Accounting Method
- **Accounting Strategy:** Assign two coins per tree (increased from one in standard binomial heaps).
- **Cost Analysis:**
  - **Making Empty Heap:** Cost of 1, no additional coins required.
  - **Linking Trees:** Uses one coin from the two trees being linked, no extra coins needed.
  - **Union Operation:** Constant work, no change in the number of trees.
  - **Insert Operation:** Cost of 3 for creating a singleton heap and calling the lazy union.
  - **Delete Min Operation:**
    - Actual cost: \(O(t + l + \log n)\), where \(t\) is the number of trees, \(l\) is the number of linking operations, and \(\log n\) covers additional overhead.
    - Coins released by linking help offset the cost.

#### Analyzing Lazy Union with the Potential Method
- **Potential Function:** \( \Phi = C \times \text{number of trees}\), where \(C \geq 2\).
- **Potential Analysis:**
  - **Make Zero, Link, Insert:** Straightforward, similar to standard binomial heaps.
  - **Union Operation:** Simple due to the constant cost and no change in the number of trees.
  - **Delete Min Operation:**
    - Actual cost: \(O(t + l + \log n)\).
    - Change in potential: \(C \times \log n\) for new trees minus \(C \times l\) for links.
    - Amortized cost bounded by \(O(\log n)\).

#### Conclusion
- **Lazy Union Efficiency:** Demonstrates the effectiveness of lazy union in reducing the immediate cost of union operations.
- **Trade-Offs:** While union operations become cheaper, delete-min operations may incur additional cost due to the need for heap reconstruction.
- **Overall Performance:** The lazy union approach maintains efficient amortized performance across various operations.
