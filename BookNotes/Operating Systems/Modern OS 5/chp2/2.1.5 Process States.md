In any operating system, processes transition through different states based on their availability to use the CPU, their need for resources, or whether they are waiting on input/output (I/O) operations. Understanding these states and transitions is fundamental for understanding how operating systems manage processes.

---
#### **Three Core Process States**
1. **Running**: The process is currently using the CPU.
2. **Ready**: The process is ready to run but is not currently using the CPU (another process is running).
3. **Blocked**: The process cannot proceed because it is waiting for some external event (e.g., I/O operation completion).
##### **State Transitions**
Four main transitions can occur between these states:
1. **Running → Blocked**: Occurs when a process needs input or other resources not currently available.
2. **Running → Ready**: Happens when the OS preempts the running process to allocate the CPU to another process.
3. **Ready → Running**: The OS scheduler picks this process to run.
4. **Blocked → Ready**: The process was waiting for an event (e.g., I/O completion), and now the event has occurred.

The transitions are depicted in the diagram below:

```
         1. Blocked for Input
              ↓
  Running ←────────────→ Ready
    ↑         2. Scheduler   ↑ 3. Scheduler
    |                        |
    └───────→ Blocked        └────→ Input Available
              (waiting for I/O)
```

- **Transition 1**: The process blocks while waiting for an external event (e.g., reading input).
- **Transition 2**: The scheduler preempts the running process to give another process CPU time.
- **Transition 3**: When it's the process's turn to run, it transitions from ready to running.
- **Transition 4**: Once the I/O or other resource becomes available, the process moves from blocked to ready.

#### **Example in Rust: Simulating Process States**
While Rust does not directly support process state management (as it deals with threads, not processes), we can simulate the behavior of state transitions using threads and channels.

```rust
use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();
    // Simulating the "Running" state with two threads
    let producer = thread::spawn(move || {
        for i in 1..5 {
            println!("Process Running: {}", i);
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(500));
            tx.send(i).unwrap(); // Transition to "Blocked"
        }
    });

    let consumer = thread::spawn(move || {
        for _ in 1..5 {
            let val = rx.recv().unwrap(); // Transition to "Ready"
            println!("Process Ready: received {}", val);
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(500)); // Simulates running
        }
    });

    producer.join().unwrap();
    consumer.join().unwrap();
}
```
This example simulates a producer-consumer model where a process "blocks" when it sends data and becomes "ready" when receiving data.

### **2.1.6 Implementation of Processes**

To implement the process model, the OS keeps track of processes using a **Process Table**. Each entry in the process table, sometimes called a **Process Control Block (PCB)**, contains crucial information about a process. This information is necessary for managing processes, especially during context switches.
#### **Key Fields in a Process Control Block (PCB)**

| **Process Management** | **Memory Management** | **File Management** |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------- |
| Registers              | Text segment pointer  | Root directory      |
| Program counter        | Data segment pointer  | Working directory   |
| Stack pointer          | Stack segment pointer | File descriptors    |
| Priority               |                       |                     |
| Process ID (PID)       |                       |                     |
| Process state          |                       |                     |
The **PCB** allows the operating system to restore the process's context when it switches back to it after a context switch.
##### **Context Switching Steps**
1. **Save State**: The OS saves the current process’s state (program counter, registers) in the PCB.
2. **Change to New Process**: The OS scheduler selects the next process to run.
3. **Load State**: The OS loads the new process’s state from its PCB.
4. **Resume Execution**: The new process resumes execution from where it was stopped.
#### **Context Switching in Rust (Simulated with Threads)**
```rust
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let process_table = Arc::new(Mutex::new(vec![0; 5])); // Simulate 5 processes' PCBs

    let handles: Vec<_> = (0..5)
        .map(|i| {
            let pcb = Arc::clone(&process_table);
            thread::spawn(move || {
                let mut table = pcb.lock().unwrap();
                table[i] = i * 10; // Simulate saving some state for each process
                println!("Process {} context saved as {}", i, table[i]);
            })
        })
        .collect();

    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }

    // Display the simulated process table
    println!("Process Table: {:?}", process_table.lock().unwrap());
}
```

### **2.1.7 Modeling Multiprogramming**
**Multiprogramming** increases CPU utilization by allowing multiple processes to reside in memory and share the CPU. When one process is blocked (e.g., waiting for I/O), another process can use the CPU, increasing overall efficiency.
#### **CPU Utilization Formula**
CPU utilization improves with the degree of multiprogramming (i.e., the number of processes in memory). If **p** is the fraction of time a process is waiting for I/O, and **n** is the number of processes in memory:
$\text{CPU Utilization} = 1 - p^n$
##### **Graph of CPU Utilization vs Degree of Multiprogramming**
- **50% I/O Wait (p = 0.5)**: The CPU utilization rises quickly with more processes.
- **80% I/O Wait (p = 0.8)**: The system requires more processes to reduce idle time.
```
Degree of Multiprogramming (n) → 
─────────────────────────────▶
|                                   
|    CPU Utilization (%)
|   ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░
|  ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ 
| ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  
| ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  
| ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  
|────────────────────────▶ 
             n
```
---
#### **Example Calculation:**
Suppose that **p = 0.8** (processes spend 80% of the time waiting for I/O), and we have **n = 5** processes in memory. Then the CPU utilization can be calculated as:

$\text{CPU Utilization} = 1 - 0.8^5 = 1 - 0.32768 = 0.67232 \approx 67.2\%$

Increasing the degree of multiprogramming further improves CPU utilization, but gains diminish beyond a certain point.
##### **Illustrative Rust Code for Multiprogramming**
```rust
fn cpu_utilization(p: f64, n: usize) -> f64 {
    1.0 - p.powi(n as i32)
}

fn main() {
    let p = 0.8;  // 80% I/O wait time
    for n in 1..=10 {
        let utilization = cpu_utilization(p, n) * 100.0;
        println!("With {} processes, CPU utilization is {:.2}%", n, utilization);
    }
}
```
This code calculates CPU utilization for varying degrees of multiprogramming.
