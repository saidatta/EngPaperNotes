### Obsidian Notes: Synchronization and Interprocess Communication (IPC) for Staff+ Engineers

---

### ****

Interprocess Communication (IPC) is a key concept in operating systems, allowing multiple processes (or threads) to communicate and synchronize their activities. IPC mechanisms help processes avoid race conditions, ensure proper sequencing, and enable the exchange of data in a structured manner.

This section covers:
1. **Race conditions**: Situations where multiple processes or threads try to access shared resources simultaneously, leading to inconsistent results.
2. **Critical regions**: Sections of code where shared resources are accessed and need mutual exclusion to prevent race conditions.
3. **Mechanisms**: Various ways of achieving mutual exclusion, such as **busy waiting**, **spinlocks**, and **Peterson's solution**.

### **2.4.1 Race Conditions**

A **race condition** occurs when two or more processes access shared data concurrently, and the final result depends on the timing of their execution. Consider a **print spooler** example where two processes, A and B, want to print at the same time. 

**Scenario**:

- **Spooler directory**: Slots 4, 5, and 6 contain file names.
- Two variables:
  - `in`: Points to the next available slot (7).
  - `out`: Points to the next file to be printed.
  
Both processes read `in = 7`, and both attempt to insert their file names into slot 7, causing data inconsistency.

**Visual Representation**:

```ascii
    Spooler Directory
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |   | A | B | C |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
                 ^       ^
              out = 4    in = 7
```

The **race condition** arises when:
- **Process A** writes to slot 7, then gets interrupted.
- **Process B** overwrites the same slot.
- Process A resumes and overwrites the slot again, causing B's file name to be lost.

### **2.4.2 Critical Regions**

To avoid race conditions, we introduce the concept of a **critical region**. A critical region is a section of code that accesses shared resources (such as memory or files) and must not be executed by more than one process at a time.

#### **Four Conditions for Mutual Exclusion**:
1. **No two processes should be in their critical regions simultaneously**.
2. **No assumptions about the relative speeds of processes or the number of CPUs**.
3. **No process should block another process if it is not in its critical region**.
4. **No process should wait indefinitely to enter its critical region**.

```ascii
  Time
  +-------------------+
  | Process A  Process B|
  +-------------------+
  | CR       --> CR    |  A enters its critical region, B is blocked.
  +-------------------+
  | NR       --> CR    |  A leaves, B enters.
  +-------------------+
```

Where **CR** stands for **critical region** and **NR** for **non-critical region**.

### **2.4.3 Mutual Exclusion with Busy Waiting**

#### **Disabling Interrupts**:
One basic technique for mutual exclusion on single-core systems is to disable interrupts when entering a critical region and re-enable them upon exit. This prevents the CPU from switching between processes.

```rust
fn critical_region() {
    disable_interrupts();
    // Critical section code
    enable_interrupts();
}
```

This approach does not work well in **multicore** systems, as disabling interrupts on one core doesn’t affect other cores. Moreover, allowing user-level processes to disable interrupts can be dangerous, potentially leading to system-wide deadlocks.

#### **Lock Variables**:
Using a lock variable to control access to the critical section seems straightforward, but it still suffers from race conditions due to timing issues.

```rust
static mut LOCK: bool = false;

fn critical_region() {
    while unsafe { LOCK } { } // Busy waiting until lock is free
    unsafe { LOCK = true; }
    // Critical section
    unsafe { LOCK = false; }
}
```

This approach can fail if two processes read the lock simultaneously and both think they have access to the critical region.

#### **Strict Alternation**:
Strict alternation ensures that processes take turns to enter their critical regions. The following code alternates the access between two processes.

```rust
static mut TURN: usize = 0;

fn process_0() {
    while unsafe { TURN != 0 } { } // Wait if it's not process 0's turn
    // Critical section
    unsafe { TURN = 1; }  // Give turn to process 1
}

fn process_1() {
    while unsafe { TURN != 1 } { }
    // Critical section
    unsafe { TURN = 0; }  // Give turn to process 0
}
```

However, strict alternation doesn't allow processes to work independently. If one process finishes quickly, it still has to wait for the other process to finish its turn, even if the second process is in its **non-critical region**, which violates **condition 3**.

#### **Peterson’s Solution**:
Peterson’s solution combines **turn-taking** with **flags** to provide a mutual exclusion mechanism that works without hardware support for atomic instructions.

##### **Algorithm**:
1. Each process sets a flag indicating it wants to enter the critical region.
2. The process gives priority to the other process by setting the `turn` variable.
3. Both processes can only enter the critical region when the other process does not want to enter or the `turn` variable allows it.

##### **Rust Implementation**:

```rust
static mut TURN: usize = 0;
static mut FLAG: [bool; 2] = [false, false];

fn process_0() {
    unsafe {
        FLAG[0] = true;   // Indicate interest
        TURN = 1;         // Give priority to process 1
        while FLAG[1] && TURN == 1 { }  // Wait if process 1 is interested
        // Critical section
        FLAG[0] = false;  // Exit critical region
    }
}

fn process_1() {
    unsafe {
        FLAG[1] = true;
        TURN = 0;
        while FLAG[0] && TURN == 0 { }
        // Critical section
        FLAG[1] = false;
    }
}
```

This solution avoids **strict alternation** and satisfies all the conditions for mutual exclusion.

### **Event-Driven Servers and IPC**

Event-driven servers also rely on synchronization primitives, particularly when dealing with **non-blocking I/O** operations. Synchronization mechanisms ensure that even in an event-driven model, data consistency is maintained when shared resources (such as network connections or buffers) are accessed.

---

### **Summary**

In **synchronization** and **IPC**, race conditions are a common problem when processes or threads share resources. Using critical regions and ensuring **mutual exclusion** avoids conflicts. Techniques such as **disabling interrupts**, **Peterson’s solution**, and **event-driven models** help manage synchronization effectively.

Key takeaways include:
- **Mutual Exclusion**: Ensuring that only one process accesses the critical section at a time.
- **Race Conditions**: Occur when shared resources are accessed concurrently without proper synchronization.
- **Busy Waiting**: Often used in low-level synchronization but should be avoided due to performance impacts.
- **Peterson's Algorithm**: A software-based solution that ensures proper synchronization between two processes without needing atomic hardware instructions.
