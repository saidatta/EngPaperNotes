#### Overview of Shared Pages in Paging Systems
- **Context**: Common in multiprogramming systems for multiple users or processes to run the same program or use shared libraries.
- **Efficiency**: Sharing pages avoids duplicating identical pages in memory, particularly beneficial for read-only pages like program text.
- **Challenges**: Data pages are more complex to share due to potential modifications.

#### Mechanisms for Sharing Pages
1. **Separate I- and D-Spaces**:
   - **Structure**: Processes have separate page tables for I-space (instructions) and D-space (data).
   - **Sharing**: Multiple processes can share the same I-space page table while having distinct D-space page tables.
   - **Example**: Figure 3-25 shows two processes sharing the same program and its page tables.
2. **Sharing with Unified Address Space**:
   - **Without I/D Separation**: Processes can still share programs/libraries, though mechanisms are more intricate.
   - **Shared Page Management**: Requires efficient tracking of shared pages to prevent issues like accidental freeing of nonvolatile storage space.

#### Shared Pages in Process Management
- **Process Termination/Swapping**: Care needed to ensure shared pages are not improperly evicted or freed.
- **Data Sharing in UNIX**:
  - **Post-fork Behavior**: Parent and child processes share data pages, initially mapped as READ ONLY.
  - **Copy on Write Mechanism**:
    - On a write attempt, a trap occurs, leading to the creation of separate, writable copies for each process.
    - Only modified data pages are duplicated, enhancing efficiency.
    - Unmodified pages, including program pages, remain shared.

#### Implications of Shared Pages
- **Resource Utilization**: Sharing read-only pages improves memory utilization and efficiency.
- **Page Replacement Strategies**: Must account for the presence of shared pages to avoid disrupting multiple processes.
- **Data Integrity and Isolation**: Critical in shared data scenarios, especially with copy-on-write strategies.

#### Code Example: Tracking Shared Pages
```python
# Pseudo-code to illustrate shared page tracking in a paging system
class Page:
    def __init__(self, is_shared=False):
        self.is_shared = is_shared
        self.reference_count = 0 if is_shared else 1

shared_page = Page(is_shared=True)

def increment_reference(page):
    page.reference_count += 1

def decrement_reference(page):
    page.reference_count -= 1
    if page.reference_count == 0:
        # Page can be safely freed or evicted
```

#### Key Takeaways
- **Efficient Memory Use**: Shared pages significantly reduce memory requirements for common or identical code across processes.
- **Complexity**: Implementing and managing shared pages adds complexity, especially in tracking and maintaining data integrity.
