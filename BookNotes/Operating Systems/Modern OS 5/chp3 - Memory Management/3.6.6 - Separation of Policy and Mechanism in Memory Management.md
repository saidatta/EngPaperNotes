#### Overview
Separating policy and mechanism in memory management, exemplified in systems like Mach, offers modular code and flexibility. This approach divides memory management into three parts: MMU handler, page-fault handler, and external pager.

#### 1. Low-Level MMU Handler
- **Function**: Handles the specifics of Memory Management Unit (MMU) operation.
- **Characteristics**: 
  - Machine-dependent.
  - Needs rewriting for each platform.

#### 2. Page Fault Handler (Kernel Component)
- **Role**: Contains most mechanisms for paging.
- **Characteristics**: 
  - Machine-independent.
  - Manages the core processes of handling page faults.

#### 3. External Pager (User Space Process)
- **Responsibility**: Determines the policy for paging.
- **Operations**: 
  - Sets up page maps and allocates backing store on nonvolatile storage.
  - Notified upon process startup and when mapping new objects.

#### Page Fault Handling Process
1. **Fault Occurrence**: User process triggers a page fault.
2. **Fault Handler Activation**: Determines the needed virtual page.
3. **Communication with External Pager**: Fault handler notifies the external pager, requesting the needed page.
4. **Page Retrieval**: External pager fetches the page from nonvolatile storage.
5. **Page Transfer**: Page is transferred to the fault handler.
6. **MMU Update**: MMU handler maps the page into the user's address space.

#### Page Replacement Algorithm Location
- **Options**: Either in the external pager or the kernel.
- **Challenges**: External pager lacks access to R (Referenced) and M (Modified) bits, crucial for many algorithms.

#### Advantages of the Implementation
- **Modularity**: Clear separation of concerns between hardware-specific operations, paging mechanisms, and policy decisions.
- **Flexibility**: Easier to modify or replace components, particularly the paging policy.

#### Disadvantages
- **Performance Overhead**: Additional cost due to user-kernel boundary crossings and messaging between system components.
- **Controversy**: Balancing performance loss against software reliability and complexity.

#### Additional Notes
- **Linux Support**: Some operating systems, like Linux, support on-demand paging in user processes, indicating a trend towards accepting some performance trade-offs for better software reliability.
