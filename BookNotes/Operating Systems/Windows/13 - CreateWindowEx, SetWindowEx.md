It appears there may be some confusion regarding an API named `SetWindowsEx`. There is no standard Win32 function by this exact name. The most likely candidates that might be causing confusion are:

- **`CreateWindowEx`**: Creates a window with extended window styles.
- **`SetWindowLong` / `SetWindowLongPtr`**: Modifies certain attributes (like styles or the window procedure) of an existing window.
- **`SetWindowsHookEx`**: Installs a hook procedure for certain system-wide or thread-specific events (not directly related to creating or modifying windows themselves).

Given the context of creating and managing windows, the most relevant function to discuss in detail, assuming a mix-up, is **`SetWindowLongPtr`** (or on older systems `SetWindowLong`), since it’s directly related to changing a window’s properties after creation. If you meant `CreateWindowEx`, that function is simply an extended version of `CreateWindow` allowing more style options. We’ll cover both briefly:

---
## `CreateWindowEx`

**Purpose:**
`CreateWindowEx` is similar to `CreateWindow` but provides additional parameters for specifying extended window styles (ex-styles). Extended styles can affect appearance and behavior, such as always-on-top windows, tool windows, or layered windows.

**Prototype:**
```c
HWND CreateWindowEx(
    DWORD dwExStyle,
    LPCTSTR lpClassName,
    LPCTSTR lpWindowName,
    DWORD dwStyle,
    int x, int y, int nWidth, int nHeight,
    HWND hWndParent,
    HMENU hMenu,
    HINSTANCE hInstance,
    LPVOID lpParam
);
```

**Key Points:**
- `dwExStyle`: Extended window styles like `WS_EX_TOPMOST`, `WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW`, `WS_EX_LAYERED`.
- Otherwise similar to `CreateWindow`.
- Internally calls into the same internal routine as `CreateWindow`, just adding extended style bits before the kernel-mode window object is created.

**When to Use:**
- When you need special behaviors, such as a topmost window, a window with a custom border, or tool-like UI elements that differ from standard windows.

**Internals:**
- `CreateWindowEx` passes extra style flags down to `NtUserCreateWindowEx`, influencing how the window manager (win32k.sys) sets up the window’s internal structures.
- The additional flags might affect window focus rules, Z-ordering, hit-testing, and other subtle UI behaviors.

## `SetWindowLong` / `SetWindowLongPtr`

If you meant a function that modifies an already existing window’s attributes, `SetWindowLong` (or `SetWindowLongPtr` on 64-bit systems) is the function you’re looking for.

**Purpose:**
`SetWindowLong` or `SetWindowLongPtr` changes various aspects of an existing window, such as:
- Window styles (`GWL_STYLE`, `GWL_EXSTYLE`)
- The window procedure address (`GWLP_WNDPROC`), enabling window subclassing.
- User data associated with the window (`GWLP_USERDATA`).
- Other class-dependent data fields.

**Prototype:**
```c
LONG_PTR SetWindowLongPtr(
    HWND hWnd,
    int nIndex,
    LONG_PTR dwNewLong
);
```

**Common Values for `nIndex`:**
- `GWL_STYLE`: Change the window’s standard style flags.
- `GWL_EXSTYLE`: Change the extended style flags set at creation.
- `GWLP_WNDPROC`: Replace the window’s procedure pointer (subclassing).
- `GWLP_USERDATA`: Store a pointer or integer associated with the window.

**Example:**
```c
// Change the window style to add a border
SetWindowLongPtr(hWnd, GWL_STYLE,
    GetWindowLongPtr(hWnd, GWL_STYLE) | WS_BORDER);

// Subclass the window
SetWindowLongPtr(hWnd, GWLP_WNDPROC, (LONG_PTR)MyNewWndProc);
```

**Internals:**
- `SetWindowLongPtr` calls into user-mode stubs that invoke `NtUserSetWindowLongPtr` (native call).
- This native call updates the kernel-mode data structure representing the window, altering attributes, or changing pointers.
- Changing `GWLP_WNDPROC` updates internal callback pointers so future messages are routed to the new procedure.
- Any style changes may cause the window manager to request a redraw or re-layout, depending on which styles changed.

**When to Use:**
- When you need to dynamically alter window behavior without recreating it.
- Useful for adding/removing styles (e.g., making a window resizable or removing its system menu at runtime).
- Commonly used in custom control libraries to implement subclassing.

---

## `SetWindowsHookEx` (For completeness)

`SetWindowsHookEx` is unrelated to creating or modifying a window directly. It’s used to install hooks that monitor low-level keyboard, mouse, or other system events:
```c
HHOOK SetWindowsHookEx(
    int idHook,
    HOOKPROC lpfn,
    HINSTANCE hMod,
    DWORD dwThreadId
);
```
- This sets a callback invoked for certain events (like keyboard input or window procedure calls).
- Useful for system-wide monitoring or debugging, but not directly for creating or altering windows.

---

## Summary

- There is no `SetWindowsEx` API in the standard Win32 API set.
- If you meant `CreateWindowEx`, it’s `CreateWindow` with extended styles for more sophisticated UI behavior.
- If you meant `SetWindowLong/SetWindowLongPtr`, it modifies properties of existing windows, allowing style changes, subclassing, or changing user data.
- If you meant `SetWindowsHookEx`, it’s about hooking global or thread-specific events, not window creation or style manipulation.

Understanding these different functions and their respective roles is crucial when working with the Windows GUI subsystem at a low level.
