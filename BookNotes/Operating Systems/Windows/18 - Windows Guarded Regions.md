**Overview:**  
A "guarded region" in the Windows kernel is a code block within which **Asynchronous Procedure Calls (APCs)** are disabled for the current thread. When a thread enters a guarded region, the kernel effectively raises the thread’s IRQL (Interrupt Request Level) to **APC_LEVEL (1)**, preventing both normal and special kernel-mode APC delivery. When the thread leaves the guarded region, the IRQL returns to its previous level, allowing APCs to resume. This mechanism ensures that certain sensitive operations cannot be interrupted by APCs, maintaining data integrity and proper synchronization.

## Why Guarded Regions?
**APCs** are a mechanism that allows asynchronous code to be queued to a thread and run at certain safe points. While useful, they can disrupt critical operations if they occur at the wrong time. Guarded regions:
- **Prevent Interruption:**  
  By disabling APCs, the current thread’s code can execute a critical section of code without being preempted by user-mode or kernel-mode APCs.
- **Synchronization and Integrity:**  
  Commonly used when code manipulates shared data structures or kernel objects that must not be changed mid-operation.
**Analogy:**  
Think of a guarded region as putting up a "Do Not Disturb" sign for your thread. APCs (like unexpected guests) must wait until you remove the sign before they can deliver their message.

## Internals
- **IRQL and APCs:**
  - Windows uses IRQLs to control what interrupts and system actions can occur.
  - Normally, threads run at `PASSIVE_LEVEL (0)`.
  - Raising to `APC_LEVEL (1)` stops APCs from being delivered.
- **KeEnterGuardedRegion/KeLeaveGuardedRegion:**
  - These kernel-mode functions encapsulate the logic of entering/leaving a guarded region.
  - Internally, the kernel increments a count of how many times the thread entered a guarded region.
  - When the count is positive, the thread IRQL is at least `APC_LEVEL`.
- **Nesting Guarded Regions:**
  - A thread can enter a guarded region multiple times, incrementing a counter.
  - Only after leaving the guarded region the same number of times (decrementing the counter to zero) do APCs become enabled again.

## Code Example (Kernel-Mode C)

```c
#include <ntifs.h> // Kernel definitions

VOID ExampleFunction() {
    // Before: IRQL = PASSIVE_LEVEL, APCs allowed
    KeEnterGuardedRegion();
    // Now APCs are disabled for this thread, IRQL = APC_LEVEL

    // Perform critical operations here
    // For example, manipulate a shared list without worrying about APCs
    // or asynchronous changes interrupting.

    // Once done, re-enable APCs
    KeLeaveGuardedRegion();
    // After: IRQL = PASSIVE_LEVEL restored, APCs allowed again
}
```

**What this does:**  
- `KeEnterGuardedRegion()` raises the IRQL to `APC_LEVEL` for the current thread. This prevents delivery of both normal and special kernel APCs.
- `KeLeaveGuardedRegion()` lowers it back. If nested, you must leave as many times as entered.

## Practical Use Cases

1. **Non-Interruptible Operations:**  
   When code updates complex shared structures (like a linked list or a hash table) that must remain consistent, a guarded region ensures no unexpected APC-based code runs in the middle of an update.

2. **Short Critical Sections:**  
   If a mutex or fast lock is held briefly and cannot tolerate asynchronous changes, developers might use a guarded region.

3. **Deferred Procedure Calls (DPC) Safety:**  
   While guarded regions primarily block APCs, running at APC_LEVEL also influences how DPCs might interact. Although DPCs run at DISPATCH_LEVEL, not APC_LEVEL, ensuring APCs are off can help stabilize certain sequences of operations.

## Guarded Regions vs. Other Synchronization Mechanisms

- **Spinlocks / Mutexes:**  
  These prevent other threads from accessing resources but do not stop APCs from arriving to the current thread. APCs can still occur while holding a spinlock, potentially causing deadlocks if the APC tries to acquire the same lock or resource.
  
- **Guarded Regions:**  
  Complement other synchronization:  
  - Prevent interruptions that might cause re-entrancy or partial state updates.
  - Simpler than changing IRQL manually or disabling interrupts directly.

**Note:** Guarded regions only affect the current thread. Other threads and their APCs are unaffected.

---
## Internals and Tracing
- **Thread Structure (KTHREAD):**
  - The thread’s kernel structure keeps track of how many times it entered a guarded region.
  - On each `KeEnterGuardedRegion()`, increments a counter.
  - On `KeLeaveGuardedRegion()`, decrements the counter.
  - IRQL is effectively `APC_LEVEL` if counter > 0.
- **Performance Considerations:**
  - Entering/leaving a guarded region is cheap. It mostly changes a small field in the KTHREAD and adjusts IRQL.
  - Minimal overhead ensures guarded regions can be widely used in system code.
- **ETW and Guarded Regions:**
  - While ETW does not directly show guarded regions as events, you can often infer them if you know the code path.
  - Developers rarely need to trace these calls; they are internal synchronization constructs mostly used by kernel components, drivers, or advanced system software.

## Example Scenario

**Situation:**  
A kernel driver manages a global list of active connections. Inserting/removing connections involves updating a linked list. Interruptions from APCs could cause half-updated pointers, leading to corruption.

**Solution with Guarded Region:**
```c
KeEnterGuardedRegion();
// Update linked list pointers safely...
InsertTailList(&GlobalConnectionList, &NewConnection->ListEntry);
// No APC can preempt this update
KeLeaveGuardedRegion();
```

When the update finishes, leaving the guarded region allows APCs to resume. If an APC tried to run during the update, it simply waited until we left.

## Summary

- **What is a Guarded Region?**
  A state where the current thread runs at `APC_LEVEL`, blocking APCs to avoid asynchronous interruptions.

- **How to Enter/Leave?**
  Use `KeEnterGuardedRegion()` and `KeLeaveGuardedRegion()` in kernel mode.

- **Benefits:**
  Ensures short, critical code paths run uninterrupted, maintaining data integrity.

- **Caution:**
  Keep guarded regions short. Extended periods at `APC_LEVEL` can delay APCs that might be important elsewhere, potentially impacting system responsiveness.

In essence, guarded regions are a lightweight kernel primitive to ensure certain operations proceed atomically in the face of asynchronous APCs. They form part of the intricate toolkit Windows provides to kernel developers for safe and efficient concurrency control.
