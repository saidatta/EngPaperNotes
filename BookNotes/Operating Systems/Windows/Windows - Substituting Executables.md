## Overview
Substituting one executable for another on Windows can be achieved using the “Image File Execution Options” (IFEO) registry mechanism. This technique was originally designed for debugging scenarios, allowing you to specify a debugger that automatically attaches whenever a particular program is started. However, the same mechanism can be leveraged to redirect the launching of one program to another arbitrary executable.

**Key Concept:**  
- By setting the `Debugger` value under the IFEO registry key for a given executable name, you instruct Windows to run the specified debugger (or any chosen executable) instead of the original target application.

## Typical Use Case (Example: Process Explorer Replacing Task Manager)

Tools like **Process Explorer** can replace **Task Manager** without overwriting the actual `taskmgr.exe` file. Normally, you might expect that to involve renaming executables or copying new files into `C:\Windows\System32`. Instead, the tool modifies the registry so that whenever `taskmgr.exe` is invoked, Windows launches `procexp.exe` (Process Explorer) instead.

This means:
- The original `taskmgr.exe` remains intact in `C:\Windows\System32`.
- Double-clicking `taskmgr.exe` or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+Esc` no longer starts the default Task Manager.
- Instead, it starts Process Explorer, thanks to the registry redirection.

## How It Works Internally
When Windows creates a process via `CreateProcess()`, it checks the IFEO registry keys to determine if any special settings apply to that executable. If a `Debugger` value is present for that executable name:
1. **Original Action:** Windows intends to run `X.exe`.
2. **IFEO Check:** Registry says: For `X.exe`, before running it, run `DebuggerString` from the IFEO entry.
3. **Result:** Instead of just starting `X.exe`, Windows launches the specified “debugger” (or substitute) executable. Typically, the debugger is passed the path to `X.exe` as a parameter, but if the substitute ignores parameters or is crafted cleverly, it can simply run itself, effectively replacing the original program.

**Note:** The IFEO mechanism was designed for debugging. The `Debugger` value is supposed to point to a real debugger like WinDbg or Visual Studio’s debugger. However, there’s no technical limitation preventing you from specifying a non-debugger application.

## Registry Path and Values

The registry key that controls this behavior:

```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options
```

Under this key, create a subkey named after the target executable (e.g., `Notepad.exe` or `Taskmgr.exe`). Within that subkey, create a `String Value` named `Debugger` and set it to the path of the substitute program.

**For example:**
```none
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\notepad.exe
    Debugger = "C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe"
```

Now every time you try to run `notepad.exe`, the calculator (`calc.exe`) runs instead.

## Example: Replacing Notepad with Calculator

**Without IFEO:**
- Running `notepad` from Start or command line opens Notepad.
**With IFEO:**
1. Open `gflags.exe` (part of Debugging Tools for Windows) or use Registry Editor manually.
2. In `gflags`, go to `Image File` tab, type `notepad.exe`.
3. Set the `Debugger` field to `C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe`.
4. Click `Apply`.

Alternatively, directly via registry:
```reg
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\notepad.exe]
"Debugger"="C:\\Windows\\System32\\calc.exe"
```

**Result:**  
- Launch `notepad.exe` → Calculator starts instead of Notepad.

To revert, remove the `Debugger` entry from the IFEO registry key.

---
## Using gflags (Global Flags Editor)
**gflags.exe** provides a GUI way to manipulate these settings:
1. Launch `gflags.exe` (installed with Windows SDK and Debugging Tools).
2. **Image File** tab → Enter the target executable’s name (e.g., `taskmgr.exe`).
3. Enter the debugger path in the `Debugger` field.
4. Click `Apply` to write changes to registry.
5. Now any attempt to run `taskmgr.exe` launches the specified debugger/substitute.
**Removing the Override:**
- Clear the `Debugger` field or delete the registry key and values created under IFEO. Click `Apply`.
---

## Practical Considerations and Limitations

- **Partial Path Matching:**  
  IFEO uses only the filename of the executable (`notepad.exe`) and not its full path. Any attempt to run `notepad.exe`—from `C:\Windows\System32` or another location—will be intercepted.

- **Debugging Intended:**  
  This feature is intended to assist in debugging processes that you cannot easily control, such as system services or applications started by external processes. By specifying a debugger, you can break in at process startup.

- **Security Implications:**  
  Abuse of IFEO can redirect system or trusted executables to malicious programs. This is a known technique sometimes used by malware or attackers to trick the system into running unexpected code. As an administrator or engineer, ensure you understand the implications before using this method in production environments.

- **Bypassing the Replacement:**  
  Debuggers typically set `DEBUG_PROCESS` or related flags when starting the target program, which prevents infinite redirection. A well-written debugger or a real debugging scenario won’t get stuck substituting itself. If you do run into recursive redirections, you may have to temporarily remove the IFEO setting to proceed.

## Code and Scripting Examples

**PowerShell Registry Manipulation:**
```powershell
$exeName = "notepad.exe"
$debuggerPath = "C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe"

New-Item -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\$exeName" -Force
New-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\$exeName" `
 -Name "Debugger" -Value $debuggerPath -PropertyType String
```

**C++ Code Using Win32 Registry APIs:**
```cpp
#include <windows.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    const char* targetExe = "notepad.exe";
    const char* debuggerPath = "C:\\Windows\\System32\\calc.exe";
    HKEY hKey;
    char keyPath[512];
    sprintf_s(keyPath, sizeof(keyPath),
              "SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Image File Execution Options\\%s", targetExe);

    if (RegCreateKeyExA(HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, keyPath, 0, NULL, 0,
        KEY_SET_VALUE, NULL, &hKey, NULL) == ERROR_SUCCESS) {
        RegSetValueExA(hKey, "Debugger", 0, REG_SZ, 
                       (BYTE*)debuggerPath, (DWORD)strlen(debuggerPath) + 1);
        RegCloseKey(hKey);
        printf("Successfully set debugger for %s to %s\n", targetExe, debuggerPath);
    } else {
        printf("Failed to set debugger.\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
```

## Summary

- **What:** Using Image File Execution Options to replace or intercept executables on Windows.
- **How:** By adding a `Debugger` registry value under the `Image File Execution Options\<exename>` key.
- **Why:** Originally for debugging processes at startup, but can also be used to redirect execution from one executable to another.
- **Cleanup:** Remove or clear the `Debugger` value to restore normal behavior.

This technique is powerful and must be used with caution. It can aid debugging, testing, or the integration of advanced monitoring tools. However, due to potential security and system stability implications, use it judiciously.
