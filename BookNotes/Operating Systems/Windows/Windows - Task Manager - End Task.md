## Overview

The **"End Task"** button in Task Manager can terminate processes in two distinct ways:
1. **Using `TerminateProcess` (Details Tab):**
   - Forcefully terminates the process, bypassing any cleanup.
   - The process does not get a chance to save data or release resources gracefully.
2. **Using `WM_CLOSE` (Processes Tab):**
   - Sends a `WM_CLOSE` message to the selected window.
   - Provides the process an opportunity to handle the message (e.g., prompting the user to save unsaved data) before terminating.
   - If the window closes, the process might exit voluntarily.

---
## Behavior Analysis
### Processes Tab
- When "End Task" is used on a **window node**, a `WM_CLOSE` message is sent to the main window of the process.
- If the process handles `WM_CLOSE` appropriately, it may close the window and terminate gracefully.
- If the process has unsaved changes, it might prompt the user before closing.
### Details Tab
- "End Task" directly calls the `TerminateProcess` API.
- This method is brute-force:
  - Immediately terminates the process without warning.
  - Does not invoke any cleanup code or destructors within the process.
  - Use only when necessary (e.g., unresponsive or malicious processes).

## Implementation Examples

### Using `TerminateProcess`

This approach demonstrates how to use the `TerminateProcess` API to forcibly terminate a process given its PID.

#### Code

```cpp
#include <windows.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    if (argc < 2) {
        printf("Usage: KillProcess <PID>\n");
        return 1;
    }

    // Parse the process ID from command-line arguments
    DWORD pid = (DWORD)atoi(argv[1]);

    // Open the process with termination rights
    HANDLE hProcess = OpenProcess(PROCESS_TERMINATE, FALSE, pid);
    if (!hProcess) {
        printf("Failed to open process. Error: %lu\n", GetLastError());
        return 1;
    }

    // Terminate the process
    if (TerminateProcess(hProcess, 1)) {
        printf("Process %lu terminated successfully.\n", pid);
    } else {
        printf("Failed to terminate process. Error: %lu\n", GetLastError());
    }

    // Close the process handle
    CloseHandle(hProcess);
    return 0;
}
```

#### Example

1. Open Task Manager and note the PID of a running process (e.g., Notepad).
2. Compile and run the program:
   ```bash
   KillProcess.exe <PID>
   ```
3. The process is terminated immediately, without saving data or performing any cleanup.

---

### Using `WM_CLOSE`

This approach demonstrates sending a `WM_CLOSE` message to a window owned by the target process, allowing the application to handle the message.

#### Code

```cpp
#include <windows.h>
#include <stdio.h>

// Callback function for EnumWindows
BOOL CALLBACK CloseWindowCallback(HWND hwnd, LPARAM lParam) {
    DWORD processId;
    GetWindowThreadProcessId(hwnd, &processId);

    // Check if the window belongs to the target process
    if (processId == (DWORD)lParam) {
        printf("Sending WM_CLOSE to window: %p\n", hwnd);
        PostMessage(hwnd, WM_CLOSE, 0, 0);
        return FALSE; // Stop enumeration after finding the first window
    }
    return TRUE; // Continue enumeration
}

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    if (argc < 2) {
        printf("Usage: CloseWindow <PID>\n");
        return 1;
    }

    // Parse the process ID from command-line arguments
    DWORD pid = (DWORD)atoi(argv[1]);

    // Enumerate all top-level windows and send WM_CLOSE to the target window
    if (!EnumWindows(CloseWindowCallback, (LPARAM)pid)) {
        printf("Failed to find or close window for process %lu.\n", pid);
    } else {
        printf("WM_CLOSE sent to process %lu.\n", pid);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

#### Example

1. Open a Notepad instance and type some text.
2. Note the PID of Notepad from Task Manager.
3. Compile and run the program:
   ```bash
   CloseWindow.exe <PID>
   ```
4. If Notepad has unsaved changes, it prompts the user to save before exiting. If there are no changes, it closes immediately.

## Comparing the Two Methods

| **Aspect**           | **TerminateProcess**              | **WM_CLOSE**                      |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Behavior**          | Forceful termination             | Graceful closure request          |
| **Cleanup**           | No cleanup (resources are lost)  | Allows cleanup (e.g., saving data)|
| **Speed**             | Immediate                        | Depends on application behavior   |
| **Use Case**          | Unresponsive or malicious apps   | Normal termination                |
| **API Used**          | `TerminateProcess`               | `PostMessage(WM_CLOSE)`           |

## Exploring in Task Manager

1. Open Task Manager.
2. Go to the **Processes** tab:
   - Right-click on a process → **End Task**.
   - Sends a `WM_CLOSE` message.
3. Go to the **Details** tab:
   - Select a process → **End Task**.
   - Calls `TerminateProcess`.

### Process Explorer: Observing the Differences
- Use **Process Explorer** to see the behavior:
  1. Launch Notepad.
  2. Right-click the Notepad window in **Processes Tab** → "End Task".
     - Observe the `WM_CLOSE` message and potential prompt.
  3. Right-click Notepad in **Details Tab** → "End Task".
     - Observe immediate termination.

---

## Notes for Advanced Use Cases

- **Protected Processes:**  
  Some processes cannot be terminated (e.g., system-critical processes or those protected by `PsProtectedSigner` flags). Both methods will fail for such processes.

- **Custom Termination Logic:**  
  For applications that require more granular control (e.g., saving state or sending termination signals), consider designing the application to handle `WM_CLOSE` or custom messages more robustly.

- **Security Implications:**  
  Misusing `TerminateProcess` or `WM_CLOSE` can lead to data loss or corruption. Always use these methods responsibly.

---

## Summary

The "End Task" button in Task Manager provides two termination strategies:

1. **Processes Tab (WM_CLOSE):** Sends a `WM_CLOSE` message to the window, allowing the application to handle termination gracefully.
2. **Details Tab (TerminateProcess):** Directly calls `TerminateProcess`, forcing immediate termination.

By understanding these mechanisms, engineers can better troubleshoot and manage processes in Windows.
