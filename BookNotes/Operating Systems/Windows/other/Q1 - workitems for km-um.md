This statement is referencing how **Work Items** (sometimes also called "worker items") function in the Windows kernel environment, and how their "Ex" (extended) variants can be utilized. Let’s break down the components:
### Work Items in the Windows Kernel
- **Work Items** are a mechanism provided by the Windows kernel to defer execution of code to a system worker thread at `PASSIVE_LEVEL` IRQL.
- When a driver or kernel component needs to do some non-urgent work without blocking the current thread, it can queue a work item. The kernel schedules these items and runs them later in a safe, low IRQL context.
- This allows kernel-mode code to perform lengthy operations asynchronously, outside the timing constraints of interrupt service routines or dispatch-level code.
### Kernel-Mode (KM) to User-Mode (UM) Communication

- Typically, communication between kernel-mode drivers and user-mode applications involves IRPs, IOCTLs, or shared memory. However, the statement suggests that work items can be part of a pattern enabling interaction or coordination between kernel-mode and user-mode tasks.
- For example, a driver might receive a user-mode request (via an IRP or IOCTL), and instead of handling it directly at the dispatch routine, the driver queues a work item. This deferred work can then process data and eventually complete the IRP, effectively bridging the request from user mode to kernel mode in a controlled manner.
- While work items themselves don’t directly send data to user mode, they enable asynchronous handling of user-mode originated requests. The kernel code triggered by a user-mode request can do its complex logic later via a work item and then respond back to the user-mode caller when done.

### Calling Filesystem as Object Type for the "Ex" Version

- The phrase "calling filesystem as object type for the Ex version" likely refers to the existence of "Ex" variants of certain functions or work item routines that allow more direct or extended interaction with system objects, including file system objects.
- In Windows, functions prefixed with "Ex" generally provide more advanced or extended capabilities than their older or simpler counterparts. For instance, `ExQueueWorkItem` is a kernel routine to queue a work item, and there might be extended routines or related mechanisms that handle objects (like file objects) more explicitly.
- By "calling filesystem as object type," it suggests that the extended or "Ex" functions and data structures might support using file system handles or objects within these work items, enabling direct file system operations while deferred in a worker thread.
- This could mean that, within the extended environment (like using certain extended APIs), you can treat file system entities as first-class objects within your asynchronous operations handled by work items.
### Putting It All Together
- **Without "Ex" versions:**  
  You typically use `IoQueueWorkItem` or `ExQueueWorkItem` to schedule a routine at `PASSIVE_LEVEL`. This routine can finalize a user-mode request, do some processing, and then return results. This indirectly supports kernel-mode to user-mode request handling by deferring complicated work until it's safer and simpler to run.

- **With "Ex" versions and object types:**  
  If you’re dealing with file systems or objects that are normally associated with a file system, certain "Ex" routines or extended capabilities allow you to incorporate these objects directly into the work item flow. This could make it easier to perform file system operations asynchronously within a work item.

In essence:

- **Work Items**: A generic kernel mechanism for deferred execution.
- **KM<->UM Communication**: Work items facilitate asynchronous handling of user requests initiated from user mode, as the driver can process data and complete IRPs later.
- **"Ex" Version and File System Objects**: Extended or "Ex" variants of routines or usage patterns that allow treating file system objects as first-class citizens in work item processing.

This leads to more flexible and powerful asynchronous I/O operations, where you can handle complex file system interactions in a deferred manner while maintaining robust communication patterns between user and kernel mode.
