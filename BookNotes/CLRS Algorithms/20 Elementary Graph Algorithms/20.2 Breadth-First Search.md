#### Overview
Chapter 20.2 explores Breadth-First Search (BFS), a fundamental graph traversal algorithm. BFS is critical for many graph-related algorithms and is useful in scenarios ranging from shortest path problems to network flow analysis.

#### Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- **Purpose**: BFS is used to systematically explore the edges of a graph to discover every vertex reachable from a source vertex `s`.
- **Process**:
  - BFS starts at the source vertex `s` and explores the graph layer by layer.
  - It discovers all vertices at distance `k` from `s` before discovering vertices at distance `k+1`.
  - BFS computes the shortest path from `s` to each reachable vertex, where the shortest path is defined by the least number of edges.

#### BFS Algorithm
1. **Initialization**:
   - Color each vertex white, set the distance `v.d` to ∞, and the predecessor `v.π` to NIL (except for the source vertex).
   - Set the source vertex `s` color to gray, `s.d` to 0, and `s.π` to NIL.
2. **Queue Operations**:
   - A first-in, first-out queue `Q` is maintained, containing the frontier of the search (gray vertices).
   - Dequeue vertex `u` and examine its adjacent vertices.
   - If an adjacent vertex `v` is white, it is discovered (colored gray), its distance is updated, its predecessor is set, and it is enqueued.
   - Once all adjacent vertices are examined, color `u` black.
3. **Termination**:
   - BFS terminates when the queue `Q` is empty.

#### Attributes in BFS
- **Color**: Indicates the state of each vertex (white: undiscovered, gray: discovered but not fully explored, black: fully explored).
- **Distance `v.d`**: Stores the distance from the source vertex `s` to a vertex `v`.
- **Predecessor `v.π`**: Points to the predecessor of `v` in the BFS tree.

#### BFS Tree
- BFS constructs a breadth-first tree, initially containing only the root `s`.
- The tree contains all reachable vertices and represents the shortest paths from `s` to these vertices.
- The `π` attribute of each vertex helps trace back the shortest path from `s` to that vertex.

#### Analysis of BFS
- **Running Time**: `O(V + E)` where `V` is the number of vertices and `E` is the number of edges in the graph.
- **Space Complexity**: Dominated by the queue `Q` and the space needed to store vertex attributes.
- **Correctness**: BFS correctly computes the shortest-path distances and constructs a breadth-first tree.

#### Applications of BFS
- Finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.
- Computing connected components in a graph.
- Network flow algorithms and minimum spanning tree algorithms often utilize BFS principles.

#### Implementing BFS
- **Graph Representation**: BFS can be implemented using either adjacency lists or adjacency matrices.
- **Recursive vs Iterative Implementation**: BFS is typically implemented iteratively using a queue, but can also be implemented recursively.

#### Practical Considerations
- BFS is particularly efficient for sparse graphs.
- The choice of the source vertex `s` can affect the BFS tree structure.
- BFS can be modified to terminate early for specific applications (e.g., finding a path to a specific vertex).

### Example Code Snippet
```python
def BFS(graph, s):
    for u in graph.vertices - {s}:
        u.color = WHITE
        u.d = ∞
        u.π = NIL
    s.color = GRAY
    s.d = 0
    s.π = NIL
    Q = Queue()
    Q.enqueue(s)
    while not Q.is_empty():
        u = Q.dequeue()
        for v in graph.adj[u]:
            if v.color == WHITE:
                v.color = GRAY
                v.d = u.d + 1
                v.π = u
                Q.enqueue(v)
        u.color = BLACK
```

This code provides a basic implementation of BFS in a graph. It assumes the graph is represented in a way that each vertex `u` and `v` can have attributes like `color`, `d`, and `π`, and that the graph provides an adjacency list for each vertex.
