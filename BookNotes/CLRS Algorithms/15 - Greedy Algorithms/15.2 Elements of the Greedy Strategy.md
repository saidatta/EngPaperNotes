#### Overview of Greedy Strategy
- **Definition**: A greedy algorithm constructs a solution to an optimization problem through a sequence of choices, each made to optimize some local criterion.
- **Contrast with Dynamic Programming**: Unlike dynamic programming, which solves subproblems before making a choice, greedy algorithms make a choice at each step without considering the subproblems.
#### Key Steps in Developing a Greedy Algorithm
1. **Formulate Subproblems**: Cast the optimization problem into subproblems that include making a choice leading to a single subproblem.
2. **Greedy Choice Property**: Show that a local optimal choice leads to a globally optimal solution.
3. **Optimal Substructure**: Demonstrate that a solution to the subproblem, combined with the greedy choice, results in an optimal solution to the original problem.
#### Greedy Choice Property
- **Local Optimal Choice**: The algorithm makes a choice that seems the best at the moment.
- **Globally Optimal Solution**: The local choices cumulatively lead to a global solution.
- **Efficiency**: Greedy choices can often be determined more efficiently than evaluating a broader set of choices.
#### Optimal Substructure
- **Definition**: A problem exhibits optimal substructure if an optimal solution to the problem contains within it optimal solutions to subproblems.
- **Application in Greedy Algorithms**: Used to show that combining an optimal solution to a subproblem with a greedy choice yields an optimal solution to the original problem.
#### Greedy vs Dynamic Programming
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Progress top-down, making greedy choices and solving remaining subproblems.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Builds solutions bottom-up from smaller subproblems to larger ones.
#### Example: The Knapsack Problem
- **0-1 Knapsack Problem**: Items cannot be divided; the problem does not yield to a greedy solution and requires dynamic programming.
- **Fractional Knapsack Problem**: Items can be divided; a greedy solution works effectively.
#### Case Study: Knapsack Problem
- **0-1 Knapsack Problem**: 
  - **Problem**: Select items to maximize value without exceeding weight capacity.
  - **Approach**: Requires dynamic programming due to the need for evaluating many subproblems.
- **Fractional Knapsack Problem**:
  - **Problem**: Similar to 0-1 but allows fractional quantities of items.
  - **Greedy Solution**: Choose items with the highest value-to-weight ratio until the capacity is reached.
  - **Implementation**: Sort items by value-to-weight ratio and then iteratively add the best item or fraction of it.
#### Practical Applications and Considerations
- **Implementation**: Often involves sorting or using priority queues for efficient selection of the next choice.
- **Complexity**: Generally more efficient than dynamic programming in problems where greedy algorithms apply.
- **Limitations**: Not all optimization problems can be solved correctly with a greedy approach.
#### Conclusion
Greedy algorithms are a powerful tool for certain optimization problems, where making the best local choice at each step leads to an optimal global solution. Understanding the greedy-choice property and optimal substructure is crucial in designing these algorithms. While not universally applicable, they offer efficient solutions for problems where their application is appropriate.
