#### Overview of Huffman Codes
- **Definition**: Huffman codes are optimal prefix-free binary codes used for data compression.
- **Principle**: Assign shorter codes to more frequent characters and longer codes to less frequent ones.
#### Huffman's Greedy Algorithm
- **Frequency Table**: Utilizes a frequency table for each character's occurrence.
- **Optimal Binary String Representation**: Represents each character by a unique binary string (codeword).
- **Efficiency**: Achieves significant data compression (20% to 90% savings).

#### Concept of Variable-Length Codes
- **Fixed-Length vs Variable-Length**: Fixed-length codes use equal bits for each character, while variable-length codes assign different bit lengths based on frequency.
- **Example**: A file with 6 characters (a-f) with given frequencies can be more compactly encoded using variable-length codes.

#### Prefix-Free Codes
- **Definition**: No codeword is a prefix of another, simplifying decoding.
- **Representation**: Represented using a binary tree where paths from root to leaves represent codewords.
- **Decoding**: Straightforward due to the unique path for each codeword in the tree.

#### Huffman Tree Construction
- **Full Binary Tree**: An optimal code is always represented by a full binary tree with |C| leaves and |C|-1 internal nodes.
- **Cost Calculation**: The cost of a tree (total bits required) can be calculated using the formula: \(\sum_{c \in C} c.\text{freq} \cdot d_T(c)\).

#### Huffman's Algorithm
- **Process**: Constructs the optimal prefix-free tree bottom-up, merging two least frequent nodes iteratively.
- **Pseudocode**: The `HUFFMAN` function takes a set of characters with frequencies, uses a min-priority queue, and builds the Huffman tree.
- **Example**: Demonstrated with a 6-character file, showing how the tree evolves at each step.

#### Correctness of Huffman's Algorithm
- **Lemma 15.2**: There exists an optimal prefix-free code where the two least frequent characters have codewords of the same length, differing only in the last bit.
- **Lemma 15.3**: Optimal substructure property â€“ replacing a node representing two characters with an internal node and two child nodes yields an optimal tree for the original problem.
- **Theorem 15.4**: The `HUFFMAN` procedure produces an optimal prefix-free code.

#### Practical Implications
- **Implementation**: Often involves priority queues for efficient construction.
- **Applications**: Widely used in data compression algorithms due to optimal space utilization.
- **Limitations**: Requires knowledge of character frequencies beforehand.

#### Conclusion
Huffman coding is a classic example of a greedy algorithm applied to data compression. By using a binary tree to represent variable-length codes and prioritizing more frequent characters with shorter codes, Huffman's algorithm achieves efficient and optimal data compression. The process underlines the importance of the greedy-choice property and optimal substructure in algorithm design.
