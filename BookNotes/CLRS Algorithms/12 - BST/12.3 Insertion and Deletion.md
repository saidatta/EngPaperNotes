#### 12.3 Insertion and Deletion in Binary Search Trees - Overview
- **Functionality**: These operations modify the binary search tree while maintaining its properties.
- **Time Complexity**: Both operations can be implemented to run in O(h) time, where h is the height of the tree.
#### Insertion
- **Procedure**: TREE-INSERT(T, z)
- **Process**:
  - Find the correct position for the new node z.
  - Maintain pointers to traverse and insert z in the right place.
- **Algorithm**:
  ```python
  def tree_insert(T, z):
      y = None
      x = T.root
      while x is not None:
          y = x
          if z.key < x.key:
              x = x.left
          else:
              x = x.right
      z.parent = y
      if y is None:
          T.root = z
      elif z.key < y.key:
          y.left = z
      else:
          y.right = z
  ```
#### Deletion
- **Procedure**: TREE-DELETE(T, z)
- **Cases**:
  1. Node z has no left child: Replace z with its right child.
  2. Node z has a left child but no right child: Replace z with its left child.
  3. Node z has two children: Replace z with its successor.
- **Complexity**: The key part is the handling of a node with two children.
- **Algorithm**:
  ```python
  def tree_delete(T, z):
      if z.left is None:
          transplant(T, z, z.right)
      elif z.right is None:
          transplant(T, z, z.left)
      else:
          y = tree_minimum(z.right)
          if y.parent != z:
              transplant(T, y, y.right)
              y.right = z.right
              y.right.parent = y
          transplant(T, z, y)
          y.left = z.left
          y.left.parent = y
  ```

#### Transplant Subroutine
- **Purpose**: Used to replace one subtree with another.
- **Procedure**: TRANSPLANT(T, u, v)
- **Algorithm**:
  ```python
  def transplant(T, u, v):
      if u.parent is None:
          T.root = v
      elif u == u.parent.left:
          u.parent.left = v
      else:
          u.parent.right = v
      if v is not None:
          v.parent = u.parent
  ```

#### Theorem 12.3
- **Statement**: INSERT and DELETE operations can be implemented to run in O(h) time on a binary search tree of height h.

#### Binary Search Tree Insertion and Deletion
```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, key):
        self.key = key
        self.left = self.right = self.parent = None

class BinarySearchTree:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = None

    def insert(self, key):
        z = TreeNode(key)
        tree_insert(self, z)

    def delete(self, key):
        z = self.search(key)
        if z is not None:
            tree_delete(self, z)

    def search(self, key):
        x = self.root
        while x is not None and key != x.key:
            if key < x.key:
                x = x.left
            else:
                x = x.right
        return x
```
