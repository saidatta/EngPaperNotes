#### Overview
Chapter 19.1 discusses data structures for managing disjoint sets. These structures are crucial in applications where elements are grouped into disjoint sets for operations like union and find.

#### Disjoint-Set Data Structure
- **Purpose**: Maintains a collection `{S1, S2, ..., Sk}` of disjoint dynamic sets.
- **Representative**: Each set is identified by a representative, which can be any member of the set.

#### Supported Operations
1. **MAKE-SET(x)**: Creates a new set with `x` as the only member.
2. **UNION(x, y)**: Merges two disjoint sets containing `x` and `y` into one set.
3. **FIND-SET(x)**: Returns the representative of the set containing `x`.

#### Analysis Parameters
- **n**: Number of MAKE-SET operations.
- **m**: Total number of operations (MAKE-SET, UNION, FIND-SET), where `m â‰¥ n`.

#### Application Example: Connected Components in a Graph
- **Use Case**: Determining connected components in an undirected graph.
- **Procedure**: `CONNECTED-COMPONENTS(G)` processes a graph `G` to identify its connected components.
- **SAME-COMPONENT(u, v)**: Checks if vertices `u` and `v` are in the same connected component.

#### Procedures
1. **CONNECTED-COMPONENTS(G)**
   - Initially, each vertex `v` is in its own set.
   - For each edge `(u, v)`, unite the sets containing `u` and `v`.
   - Two vertices are in the same component if they are in the same set after processing all edges.

2. **SAME-COMPONENT(u, v)**
   - Returns `TRUE` if `u` and `v` are in the same set, otherwise `FALSE`.

#### Figure 19.1 Illustration
- **(a)** Shows a graph with distinct connected components.
- **(b)** Demonstrates the disjoint sets formed after processing each edge.

#### Implementation Considerations
- **Graph Representation**: Each vertex object should contain a pointer to its corresponding disjoint-set object, and vice versa.
- **Dynamic Edge Addition**: This method can be more efficient than depth-first search for dynamically changing graphs.

#### Conclusion
- Disjoint-set data structures are efficient for grouping elements and performing union and find operations.
- They are particularly useful in applications like graph processing where elements are dynamically grouped into disjoint sets.
