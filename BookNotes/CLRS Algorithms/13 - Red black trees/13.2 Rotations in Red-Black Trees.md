#### 13.2 Rotations - Overview
- **Purpose**: Rotations are crucial for maintaining red-black tree properties after insertions and deletions.
- **Types**: Left Rotations and Right Rotations.
- **Complexity**: Both operations run in O(1) time.
#### Rotations in Red-Black Trees
- **Function**: A local operation that preserves the binary-search-tree property.
- **Mechanism**:
  - **Left Rotation** (on node x): 
    - x's right child y becomes the new root of the subtree.
    - y's left subtree becomes x's right subtree.
    - x becomes the left child of y.
  - **Right Rotation** (on node y):
    - Symmetric to the left rotation.
- **Use Case**: To restore red-black properties after TREE-INSERT and TREE-DELETE operations.
#### LEFT-ROTATE Procedure
- **Assumptions**: `x.right ≠ T.nil` and the root's parent is `T.nil`.
- **Pseudocode**:
  ```python
  def left_rotate(T, x):
      y = x.right
      x.right = y.left
      if y.left != T.nil:
          y.left.p = x
      y.p = x.p
      if x.p == T.nil:
          T.root = y
      elif x == x.p.left:
          x.p.left = y
      else:
          x.p.right = y
      y.left = x
      x.p = y
  ```
#### Figure 13.2 - Rotation Operations
- **Description**: Illustration showing left and right rotation operations on a binary search tree.
- **Key Elements**: α, β, γ represent arbitrary subtrees, and the operations preserve the binary-search-tree property.

#### Practical Implications for Software Engineers
1. **Understanding Rotations**: Essential for implementing and debugging red-black trees.
2. **Restoring Tree Properties**: Use rotations to fix violations of red-black properties after insertions/deletions.
3. **Performance Optimization**: Since rotations are O(1) operations, they contribute to the efficiency of red-black trees in maintaining balance.

####  Left Rotation in a Red-Black Tree
```python
def left_rotate(T, x):
    y = x.right
    x.right = y.left
    if y.left != T.nil:
        y.left.p = x
    y.p = x.p
    if x.p == T.nil:
        T.root = y
    elif x == x.p.left:
        x.p.left = y
    else:
        x.p.right = y
    y.left = x
    x.p = y
```
