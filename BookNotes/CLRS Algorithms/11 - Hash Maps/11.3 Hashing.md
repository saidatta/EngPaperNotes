#### Overview
- This section discusses the concept of hashing, focusing on random hashing and its effectiveness in achieving good average-case performance for any data.
- Static hashing utilizes a single, fixed hash function. This section explores two standard static hashing methods: the division method and the multiplication method, and introduces the concept of random hashing.
- This section discusses methods for hashing long inputs, like vectors or strings, which exceed standard hash function input sizes.
---
#### Random Hashing
- **Definition**: Selecting a hash function at runtime from a family of hash functions, independent of the data.
- **Key Approach**: Universal hashing, effective in providing good average-case performance.
- **Comparison with Quicksort**: Similar use of randomization as a powerful algorithmic design tool.
---
#### Criteria for a Good Hash Function
1. **Independent Uniform Hashing Assumption**:
   - Each key is equally likely to hash to any of the `m` slots.
   - Independence from where other keys have hashed.

2. **Equally Likely Hashing**:
   - Based on the probability distribution of input keys.
   - Difficult to verify without knowing this distribution.

3. **Example of Ideal Distribution**:
   - Keys are random real numbers `k` in the range `0 ≤ k < 1`.
   - Hash function `h(k) = ⌊km⌋` satisfies independent uniform hashing.
---
#### Hash Function Design
- **Static Hashing**:
  - Division method: Hash value as the remainder of key divided by a prime number.
  - Effective if the prime is unrelated to patterns in key distribution.

- **Random Hashing** (Section 11.3.2):
  - Chooses hash function randomly from a family.
  - Advantage: No need to know key distribution.
---
#### Mathematical Concepts and Equations
1. **Hash Function**:
   \[ h(k) = ⌊km⌋ \]
   - For keys `k` uniformly distributed in `[0, 1)`.

2. **Division Method**:
   \[ h(k) = k \mod p \]
   - `p` is a prime number, `k` is the key.
---
#### Key Types in Hashing
1. **Short Nonnegative Integers**:
   - Fits in a `w-bit` machine word (e.g., `w = 32` or `64`).

2. **Short Vectors or Strings**:
   - Vector of nonnegative integers (e.g., 8-bit bytes).
   - Often of variable length.
---
#### Practical Application
- **Random Hashing Recommendation**:
  - Preferred due to independence from input key distribution.
---
#### Static Hashing Methods
1. **Division Method**:
   - Hash Function: \( h(k) = k \mod m \)
   - Example: For \( m = 12 \) and \( k = 100 \), \( h(k) = 4 \).
   - Best when \( m \) is a prime not close to a power of 2.
   - Limitation: Constrain hash table size to be prime.

2. **Multiplication Method**:
   - Hash Function: ![[Screenshot 2023-12-21 at 11.16.24 AM.png]]
   - \( A \) is a constant in the range \( 0 < A < 1 \).
   - Advantage: Value of \( m \) is not critical, more flexibility.
---
#### Multiply-Shift Method
- **Context**: Effective when \( m = 2^{\ell} \), where \( \ell \) is an integer.
- **Process**:
  - Multiply key \( k \) by \( w \)-bit integer \( a \) (where \( a = A \cdot 2^w \)).
  - Use the \( \ell \) highest-order bits of the lower \( w \)-bit half of the product.
- **Example**: With \( k = 123456 \), \( \ell = 14 \), \( m = 2^{14} = 16384 \), \( w = 32 \), and \( a = 2654435769 \), \( h_a(k) = 67 \).
---
#### Random Hashing
- **Definition**: Choosing a hash function randomly, independent of the keys.
- **Advantage**: Mitigates worst-case behavior against malicious key selection.
- **Concept**: Universal Hashing - Ensures good average-case performance with collision handling.
---
#### Mathematical Concepts and Equations
1. **Division Method Hash Function**:
   \[ h(k) = k \mod m \]

2. **Multiplication Method Hash Function**:
   \[ h(k) = \lfloor m (kA \mod 1) \rfloor \]

3. **Multiply-Shift Hash Function**:
   \[ h_a(k) = \text{the } \ell \text{-most significant bits of } r_0 \]
   - \( r_0 \) is the low-order \( w \)-bit word of \( k \times a \).
---
#### Universal Hashing
- **Property**: For any two distinct keys, the chance of collision is no more than \( 1/m \).
- **Implementation**: Choosing from a family of hash functions with certain desirable properties.
---
#### Theoretical Insights
- **Corollary 11.3**: Using universal hashing with chaining, expected time for a sequence of operations is \( \Theta(s) \).
- **Theorem 11.4**: A hash function family defined by linear transformations is universal.
---
#### Designing Universal Hash Function Families
- **Number Theory-Based Method**:
  - Choose a prime \( p \) and define hash functions with linear transformations.
  - Example: \( h_{a,b}(k) = ((ak + b) \mod p) \mod m \).

- **Multiply-Shift-Based Method**:
  - Use odd constants \( a \) for the multiply-shift method.
  - Provides a 2/m-universal property.
---
#### Practical Recommendations
- **Usage**: Multiply-shift-based method recommended for practical applications due to efficiency and sufficient universality.
---
#### Number-Theoretic Approaches
- **Extension of Universal Hash Functions**: Adapting the methods from Section 11.3.4 for variable-length inputs.
- **Exercise 11.3-6**: Explores a specific approach for these types of inputs.
---
#### Cryptographic Hashing
- **Purpose**: Designed for cryptographic applications but useful for hash tables due to robustness and implementation availability.
- **Features**:
  - Handles arbitrary byte string inputs.
  - Produces a fixed-length output.
  - Example: SHA-256 generates a 256-bit (32-byte) output.
---
#### Cryptographic Hash Function Examples
1. **SHA-256**:
   - Standard cryptographic hash function.
   - Output: 256-bit (32-byte) for any input.

2. **Hardware Acceleration**:
   - Some CPUs include instructions for fast cryptographic functions (e.g., AES-NI instructions).

3. **Use in Hash Tables**:
   - Fast enough for hash table applications.
   - Example: CBC-MAC based on AES.
---
#### Random Oracle and Cryptographic Hash Functions
- **Random Oracle**: A theoretical, deterministic function providing a randomly selected output for each input.
- **Practical Implementation**: Cryptographic hash functions as substitutes for random oracles.
- **Application**: Ensures same output for identical inputs, mimicking an independent uniform hash function family.
---
#### Designing Hash Functions Using Cryptography
1. **Simple Method**:
   \[ h(k) = \text{SHA-256}(k) \mod m \]
   - Maps SHA-256 output to a hash table slot.
2. **Family of Hash Functions**:
   \[ h_a(k) = \text{SHA-256}(a \Vert k) \mod m \]
   - `a`: Salt string prepended to the input.
   - `\Vert`: Denotes string concatenation.
3. **Message Authentication Codes (MACs)**:
   - Provide additional approaches for hash function design.
---
#### Practical Considerations
- **Memory Hierarchy**:
  - As computers evolve, cryptographic hashing becomes more practical.
- **Example**: RC6 encryption method-based hash function design.
---
#### Additional Notes
- **Relevance**: Especially important in applications dealing with large datasets or requiring secure hashing (e.g., databases, security applications).
- **Further Reading**: Explore sections on cryptographic hash functions and their applications in data structures.
