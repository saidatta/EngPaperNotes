#### 11.4 Open Addressing - Overview
- **Concept**: Elements occupy the hash table directly, with no external storage.
- **Load Factor (α)**: Cannot exceed 1, since the table holds all elements.
- **Collision Resolution**: Uses a probing sequence to find empty slots.
#### Insertion in Open Addressing
- **Method**: Probing the hash table for an empty slot.
- **Hash Function**: Extended to include the probe number, `h : U × {0, 1, …, m − 1} → {0, 1, …, m − 1}`.
- **Procedure**:
  - HASH-INSERT(T, k)
  - Iterate over probe sequence to find an empty slot.
  - Return slot number or error for table overflow.

#### Searching in Open Addressing
- **Method**: Follows the same probe sequence as insertion.
- **Procedure**:
  - HASH-SEARCH(T, k)
  - Iterate over probe sequence to find the key or an empty slot.
  - Return slot number or NIL.

#### Deletion in Open Addressing
- **Challenge**: Directly marking a slot as empty can cause retrieval issues.
- **Solution**: Mark deleted slots with a special value, DELETED.
- **Consideration**: This affects search time, independent of load factor.

#### Independent Uniform Permutation Hashing
- **Assumption**: Probe sequence for each key is a random permutation.
- **Practicality**: Difficult to implement; approximations like double hashing are used.

#### Double Hashing
- **Hash Function**: `h(k, i) = (h1(k) + ih2(k)) mod m`
- **Requirements**: `h2(k)` must be relatively prime to the hash-table size `m`.

#### Linear Probing
- **Special Case**: Set `h2(k) = 1` for all `k`.
- **Behavior**: Sequential probing starting from `h1(k)`.

#### Analysis of Open-Address Hashing
- **Expected Probes**: The expected number of probes depends on the load factor and the hashing method.
- **Theorems**:
  - Theorem 11.6: Expected number of probes in an unsuccessful search is at most `1/(1 - α)`.
  - Theorem 11.8: Expected number of probes in a successful search is bounded by `1/2 (1 + 1/(1 - α))`.

### Code Examples

#### Python Implementation of Open Addressing with Linear Probing
```python
class OpenAddressHashTable:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.table = [None] * size
        self.size = size

    def hash_function(self, key, probe):
        return (hash(key) + probe) % self.size

    def insert(self, key):
        for i in range(self.size):
            index = self.hash_function(key, i)
            if self.table[index] is None or self.table[index] == 'DELETED':
                self.table[index] = key
                return index
        raise Exception('Hash table overflow')

    def search(self, key):
        for i in range(self.size):
            index = self.hash_function(key, i)
            if self.table[index] == key:
                return index
            if self.table[index] is None:
                return None
        return None

    def delete(self, key):
        index = self.search(key)
        if index is not None:
            self.table[index] = 'DELETED'
```

#### Computing Load Factor
```python
def compute_load_factor(hash_table):
    occupied = sum(1 for slot in hash_table.table if slot and slot != 'DELETED')
    return occupied / hash_table.size
```

### Equations and Concepts
- **Load Factor (α)**: α = n/m
- **Expected Probes for Unsuccessful Search**: At most `1/(1 - α)`
- **Expected Probes for Successful Search**: `1/2 (1 + 1/(1 - α))`
