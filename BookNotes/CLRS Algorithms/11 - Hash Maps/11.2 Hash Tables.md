#### Overview
- **Context**: Hash tables are more space-efficient than direct addressing for large key universes.
- **Advantage**: Requires Θ(|K|) storage, maintaining O(1) average search time.
- **Limitation**: Average-case time, not worst-case as in direct addressing.
#### Hash Function
- **Purpose**: Maps keys to hash table slots, `h: U → {0, 1, …, m − 1}`.
- **Example**: A simple hash function could be `h(k) = k mod m`.
- **Issue**: Collisions (two keys hash to the same slot) are inevitable.
#### Collision Resolution
- **Goal**: Minimize or handle collisions.
- **Methods**: Chaining and Open Addressing (discussed in Section 11.4).
#### Independent Uniform Hashing
- **Ideal**: Each key has an equal and independent chance of hashing to any slot.
- **Reality**: Purely random hashing isn't practical; approximations are used.
#### Collision Resolution by Chaining
- **Mechanism**: Elements that hash to the same slot are linked in a list.
- **Operations**:
  - **Insertion**: O(1) worst-case.
  - **Search**: Proportional to the list length.
  - **Deletion**: O(1) with doubly linked lists.
#### Analysis of Hashing with Chaining
- **Load Factor (α)**: Defined as n/m (number of elements/n slots).
- **Worst Case**: All elements hash to the same slot (Θ(n)).
- **Average Case**: Dependent on hash function's distribution efficiency.
- **Theorems**:
  - Unsuccessful search: Θ(1 + α) average time.
  - Successful search: Also Θ(1 + α) average time.
#### Practical Implications
- **Efficiency**: With α = O(1), all dictionary operations average O(1) time.
- **Requirements**: Uniformity and independence in hash function.

#### Python Implementation of Chaining
```python
class HashTable:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.table = [[] for _ in range(size)]

    def insert(self, key, value):
        index = self.hash_function(key)
        self.table[index].append(value)

    def search(self, key):
        index = self.hash_function(key)
        for item in self.table[index]:
            if item.key == key:
                return item
        return None

    def delete(self, key):
        index = self.hash_function(key)
        self.table[index] = [item for item in self.table[index] if item.key != key]

    def hash_function(self, key):
        return key % len(self.table)
```
#### Analyzing Load Factor
```python
def load_factor(hash_table):
    num_elements = sum(len(chain) for chain in hash_table.table)
    num_slots = len(hash_table.table)
    return num_elements / num_slots
```
### Equations and Concepts
- **Load Factor (α)**: α = n/m
- **Search Time (Average)**: Θ(1 + α)
- **Hash Function**: h(k) = k mod m
