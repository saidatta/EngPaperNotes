#### Overview
This section covers the fundamental operations on B-Trees: searching, creating, and inserting keys.
#### B-Tree Search Operation
- **B-TREE-SEARCH Procedure**: 
  - Input: Node x (root of a subtree) and key k.
  - Output: Node y and index i, where `y.keyi = k`, or NIL if k is not present.
  - Method: Multiway branching decision at each node based on `x.n + 1` children.
  - Top-level call: `B-TREE-SEARCH(T.root, k)`.
  - Disk Accesses: O(h) = O(logt n), where h is tree height, n is number of keys.

#### Creating an Empty B-Tree
- **B-TREE-CREATE Procedure**:
  - Utilizes `ALLOCATE-NODE` to create an empty root node.
  - Sets `x.leaf = TRUE`, `x.n = 0`.
  - Disk Operations: O(1).

#### Inserting a Key into a B-Tree
- **Key Challenges**:
  - Inserting into full leaf nodes requires node splitting.
  - Ensuring valid B-tree structure post-insertion.
- **B-TREE-INSERT Procedure**:
  - Handles splitting full nodes encountered during insertion.
  - Splits full root nodes to grow the tree in height.
  - Utilizes `B-TREE-SPLIT-CHILD` and `B-TREE-INSERT-NONFULL`.

#### Splitting a Node in a B-Tree
- **B-TREE-SPLIT-CHILD Procedure**:
  - Input: Nonfull internal node x and index i.
  - Output: Splits the full child x.ci into two nodes.
  - Operations: Rearranges keys and children, moves median key to parent node x.
  - Disk Operations: O(1).

#### Inserting a Key with Single Pass Down the Tree
- **B-TREE-INSERT Procedure**:
  - Splits full root node if necessary.
  - Utilizes `B-TREE-INSERT-NONFULL` for nonfull root nodes.
- **B-TREE-INSERT-NONFULL Procedure**:
  - Inserts key k into nonfull node x.
  - Recurses down the tree, guaranteeing nonfull nodes.
  - Handles cases for leaf and internal nodes differently.

#### Computational Complexity
- Disk Accesses: O(h) for B-TREE-INSERT, where h is tree height.
- CPU Time: O(th) = O(t logt n) for both B-TREE-INSERT and B-TREE-INSERT-NONFULL.

#### Conclusion
- B-Trees provide efficient mechanisms for managing large datasets stored on disk drives, with operations carefully designed to minimize disk accesses.
- The B-TREE-INSERT operation, despite its complexity, ensures a single pass down the tree, maintaining the B-tree properties efficiently.
