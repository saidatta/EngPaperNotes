#### Overview
This section details the procedure for deleting a key from a B-tree, which is more complex than insertion due to the need for rearranging children and maintaining B-tree properties.

#### Deleting a Key from a B-tree
- **B-TREE-DELETE Procedure**: Combines searching for and deleting a key in a B-tree.
- **Assumption**: When called recursively on node x, x has at least t keys (minimum degree).
- **Key Challenge**: Avoiding underfull nodes (having fewer than t − 1 keys) during deletion.
- **Method**: Ensures at least t keys in each node as it descends through the B-tree.
- **Cases in Deletion**:
  - Case 1: Deleting from a leaf node.
  - Case 2: Deleting from an internal node containing the key.
  - Case 3: Deleting from an internal node not containing the key.

#### Case Analysis
- **Case 1**: 
  - If x contains key k, delete k from x.
  - If x doesn't contain key k, the key is not in the tree.

- **Case 2**:
  - **2a**: Predecessor of k in x's child is used if the child has ≥ t keys.
  - **2b**: Successor of k in x's child is used if the child has ≥ t keys.
  - **2c**: Merge k with a child node if both child nodes have t − 1 keys.

- **Case 3**:
  - **3a**: If x's child has only t − 1 keys but a sibling has ≥ t keys, redistribute keys.
  - **3b**: If x's child and its siblings have t − 1 keys, merge x's child with a sibling.

#### Special Case: Deleting the Root
- If node x (root) ends up with no keys, it is deleted, and its only child becomes the new root, decreasing the tree's height by one.

#### Efficiency
- **Disk Operations**: O(h) for a B-tree of height h.
- **CPU Time**: O(th) = O(t logtn), with th being proportional to tree height and number of keys.
- **Traversal**: One downward pass through the tree, without backup, for most deletions.

#### Conclusion
- Deletion in a B-tree requires careful handling to maintain its structural properties.
- The procedure is optimized for efficiency in both disk access and CPU usage.
- While the process is intricate, it ensures the integrity and balance of the B-tree.
