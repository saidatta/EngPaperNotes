#### Overview
Chapter 20.3 delves into Depth-First Search (DFS), a pivotal graph traversal technique used extensively in computing graph properties, solving puzzles, and in algorithmic paradigms like backtracking and divide-and-conquer.

#### Depth-First Search (DFS)
- **Purpose**: DFS explores a graph by moving as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It's effective in scenarios that require exploring all possible solutions or paths in a graph.
- **Process**:
  - DFS starts at a source vertex and explores as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking.
  - The algorithm recurses through adjacent vertices, creating a DFS forest composed of several DFS trees.

#### DFS Algorithm
1. **Initialization**:
   - Set each vertex's color to white, predecessor to NIL.
   - Set a global time counter.
2. **Exploration**:
   - For each white vertex `u`, call `DFS-VISIT(G, u)`.
   - In `DFS-VISIT(G, u)`, increment time, record discovery time `u.d`, and color `u` gray.
   - Explore each vertex `v` in `u`'s adjacency list. If `v` is white, set `v.π = u` and recursively call `DFS-VISIT(G, v)`.
   - After exploring all adjacent vertices, increment time, record finishing time `u.f`, and color `u` black.
3. **Termination**:
   - The algorithm terminates when all vertices have been explored.

#### Attributes in DFS
- **Color**: Indicates the state of each vertex (white: undiscovered, gray: discovered but not fully explored, black: fully explored).
- **Discovery and Finish Times (`v.d` and `v.f`)**: Timestamps recording when a vertex is discovered and finished.
- **Predecessor (`v.π`)**: Points to the predecessor of `v` in the DFS tree.

#### DFS Tree and DFS Forest
- A DFS forest is formed by the predecessor subgraph of DFS, comprising several DFS trees.
- Tree Edges: Edges in the depth-first forest.
- Back Edges: Edges connecting a vertex to an ancestor in a DFS tree.
- Forward Edges: Nontree edges connecting a vertex to a descendant in a DFS tree.
- Cross Edges: Edges that do not fall into the above categories.

#### Analysis of DFS
- **Running Time**: `O(V + E)` where `V` is the number of vertices and `E` is the number of edges in the graph.
- **Properties**:
  - DFS produces a depth-first forest with trees corresponding to recursive calls of `DFS-VISIT`.
  - Discovery and finishing times have a nested "parenthesis" structure.
  - The "White-Path Theorem": Vertex `v` is a descendant of `u` if, at `u.d`, there is a white path from `u` to `v`.

#### Edge Classification
- DFS can classify edges into tree, back, forward, or cross edges based on the state (color) of the vertex it reaches.

#### Applications of DFS
- DFS is used in topological sorting, finding connected components in a graph, solving puzzles that require exploring all possibilities, and in various algorithmic strategies like backtracking.

#### Implementing DFS
- **Graph Representation**: DFS can be implemented using either adjacency lists or adjacency matrices.
- **Recursive vs Iterative Implementation**: DFS is often implemented recursively but can also be implemented iteratively using a stack.

#### Practical Considerations
- DFS is particularly useful for graphs where exploring as deeply as possible is required.
- The choice of the source vertex and the order of visiting vertices can affect the DFS forest structure but not the discovery/finish times.
- DFS is a basis for many complex algorithms in graph theory, such as finding strongly connected components.

### Example Code Snippet
```python
def DFS(graph):
    for u in graph.vertices:
        u.color = 'WHITE'
        u.π = None
    global time
    time = 0
    for u in graph.vertices:
        if u.color == 'WHITE':
            DFS_Visit(graph, u)

def DFS_Visit(graph, u):
    global time
    time += 1
    u.d = time
    u.color = 'GRAY'
    for v in graph.adj[u]:
        if v.color == 'WHITE':
            v.π = u
            DFS_Visit(graph, v)
    time += 1
    u.f = time
    u.color = 'BLACK'
```

This code snippet provides a basic implementation of DFS. It assumes the graph is represented in a way that each vertex `u` and `v` can have attributes like `color`, `d` (

discovery time), `f` (finishing time), and `π` (predecessor), and that the graph provides an adjacency list for each vertex.
