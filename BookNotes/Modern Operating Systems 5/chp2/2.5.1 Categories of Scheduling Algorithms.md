In operating systems, different environments require different scheduling algorithms based on their specific requirements and characteristics. The three main categories of scheduling algorithms are:

1. **Batch Systems**
2. **Interactive Systems**
3. **Real-Time Systems**

Each of these environments has distinct goals that the scheduling algorithm needs to optimize for. Below, we'll explore these categories, goals, and corresponding scheduling algorithms.

#### **1. Batch Systems**

Batch systems are commonly used in business operations for tasks like payroll, inventory, claims processing, and other routine tasks. There is no need for quick user interaction, so the scheduler can focus on maximizing resource utilization and efficiency.

- **Goals in Batch Systems**:
  - **Throughput**: Maximize the number of jobs processed per hour.
  - **Turnaround Time**: Minimize the time between job submission and completion.
  - **CPU Utilization**: Keep the CPU busy as much as possible.

- **Example Scheduling Algorithms for Batch Systems**:
  - **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**: Jobs are executed in the order they arrive.
  - **Shortest Job First (SJF)**: Prioritizes jobs with the shortest burst time.
  - **Priority Scheduling**: Assigns priorities to jobs and runs the highest-priority job next.

---

#### **2. Interactive Systems**

In interactive systems, multiple users or processes interact with the computer system simultaneously. The main goal is to ensure responsiveness so that no process or user dominates the CPU, leading to long delays for others.

- **Goals in Interactive Systems**:
  - **Response Time**: Minimize the time between a user request and system response.
  - **Proportionality**: Meet user expectations by ensuring that perceived complex tasks take longer than simple tasks.

- **Example Scheduling Algorithms for Interactive Systems**:
  - **Round Robin (RR)**: Each process is given a fixed time slice, or quantum, ensuring fairness across processes.
  - **Multilevel Feedback Queue**: Processes are placed in different queues based on their behavior and execution history, allowing short jobs to execute quickly while longer jobs are prioritized differently.
  - **Priority Scheduling**: Processes with higher priority (e.g., interactive processes) are executed before lower-priority ones (e.g., background tasks).

---

#### **3. Real-Time Systems**

Real-time systems are typically used in environments where processes have strict timing constraints, such as in embedded systems, industrial control systems, or multimedia systems. Here, the scheduler needs to ensure that tasks meet their deadlines.

- **Goals in Real-Time Systems**:
  - **Meeting Deadlines**: Ensuring that tasks complete within their specified time limits.
  - **Predictability**: Consistent and regular scheduling to avoid unpredictable delays.

- **Example Scheduling Algorithms for Real-Time Systems**:
  - **Rate-Monotonic Scheduling (RMS)**: Prioritizes tasks based on the frequency of their execution (the shorter the period, the higher the priority).
  - **Earliest Deadline First (EDF)**: Prioritizes tasks based on their deadlines, ensuring that tasks with the closest deadlines are executed first.
  - **Priority Inheritance**: Helps avoid priority inversion by temporarily increasing the priority of a lower-priority process that holds a resource needed by a higher-priority process.

### **Scheduling Algorithm Goals**

The goals of scheduling algorithms differ depending on the system. Below are some common goals that apply to various environments:

#### **General Goals for All Systems**:

1. **Fairness**: All processes should receive a fair share of CPU time.
2. **Policy Enforcement**: The scheduler must enforce the system's defined policies (e.g., giving higher priority to safety-critical tasks).
3. **Balance**: Keep all parts of the system (CPU, I/O devices, etc.) busy.

#### **Batch System Goals**:

1. **Throughput**: Maximize the number of jobs processed per unit time.
2. **Turnaround Time**: Minimize the total time between job submission and job completion.
3. **CPU Utilization**: Keep the CPU busy to avoid idle times.

#### **Interactive System Goals**:

1. **Response Time**: Minimize the time between a user request and the system's response.
2. **Proportionality**: Ensure that the time taken to complete tasks is proportional to user expectations.

#### **Real-Time System Goals**:

1. **Meeting Deadlines**: Ensure that critical tasks complete before their deadlines.
2. **Predictability**: Minimize variability in scheduling decisions to maintain predictable behavior, especially for multimedia systems.

### **Scheduling Algorithm Example: Round Robin (RR)**

The **Round Robin (RR)** scheduling algorithm is one of the most common algorithms used in interactive systems. It ensures fairness by giving each process a fixed time slice, or **quantum**, to run before preemption occurs.

#### **Round Robin Algorithm Pseudocode**:

```rust
struct Process {
    id: usize,
    burst_time: usize,
}

fn round_robin(mut processes: Vec<Process>, quantum: usize) {
    let mut time = 0;

    while !processes.is_empty() {
        let mut new_processes = Vec::new();

        for mut process in processes {
            if process.burst_time > quantum {
                println!("Running process {} for {} time units", process.id, quantum);
                process.burst_time -= quantum;
                time += quantum;
                new_processes.push(process);
            } else {
                println!("Running process {} for {} time units", process.id, process.burst_time);
                time += process.burst_time;
                println!("Process {} finished", process.id);
            }
        }

        processes = new_processes;
    }
}

fn main() {
    let processes = vec![
        Process { id: 1, burst_time: 5 },
        Process { id: 2, burst_time: 8 },
        Process { id: 3, burst_time: 12 },
    ];

    let quantum = 4;
    round_robin(processes, quantum);
}
```

#### **Explanation**:

- Each process is given a **time slice (quantum)**.
- If a process's burst time exceeds the quantum, it runs for the quantum, and then its remaining time is put back in the queue.
- This continues until all processes have finished execution.
- **Round Robin** ensures that no process monopolizes the CPU, making it ideal for **time-sharing systems**.

### **Equations and Performance Metrics**

#### **1. Throughput (Batch Systems)**:

\[
\text{Throughput} = \frac{\text{Total Number of Jobs}}{\text{Total Time}}
\]

Throughput measures the number of jobs a system can complete per unit time. Higher throughput is better for batch systems where jobs do not require immediate user feedback.

#### **2. Turnaround Time (Batch Systems)**:

\[
\text{Turnaround Time} = \text{Completion Time} - \text{Arrival Time}
\]

Turnaround time represents the total time from job submission to job completion. Lower turnaround time is preferred.

#### **3. Response Time (Interactive Systems)**:

\[
\text{Response Time} = \text{First Response Time} - \text{Request Arrival Time}
\]

Response time measures the delay between the submission of a request and the first system response. Minimizing response time improves user satisfaction in interactive systems.

### **Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduling**

**Multilevel Feedback Queue (MLFQ)** is a more complex scheduling algorithm used in interactive systems. It categorizes processes based on their behavior:

- Processes that use less CPU time are placed in higher-priority queues.
- Processes that require more CPU time are moved to lower-priority queues.
- **Interactive processes** (e.g., typing commands) are favored over **CPU-bound processes**.

#### **MLFQ Example**:

```rust
fn multilevel_feedback_queue(mut processes: Vec<Process>, quantum: usize) {
    let mut queues: Vec<Vec<Process>> = vec![Vec::new(), Vec::new(), Vec::new()]; // Three priority levels

    for process in processes {
        queues[0].push(process); // Start at highest priority
    }

    while queues.iter().any(|queue| !queue.is_empty()) {
        for (i, queue) in queues.iter_mut().enumerate() {
            if let Some(mut process) = queue.pop() {
                let current_quantum = quantum * (i + 1); // Increase quantum for lower-priority queues

                if process.burst_time > current_quantum {
                    println!("Running process {} in queue {} for {} time units", process.id, i, current_quantum);
                    process.burst_time -= current_quantum;
                    queues[i + 1].push(process); // Move to lower priority
                } else {
                    println!("Running process {} in queue {} for {} time units", process.id, i, process.burst_time);
                    println!("Process {} finished", process.id);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### **Explanation**:

- **MLFQ** starts each process at the highest priority queue.
- If a process exceeds its allowed time slice, it is demoted to a lower-priority queue.
- **Shorter jobs** remain in higher-priority queues, while **longer jobs** move to lower-priority queues.

### **Conclusion**

- Different environments (batch, interactive, real-time) require different scheduling goals and algorithms.
- **Batch systems** prioritize throughput and CPU utilization, while **interactive systems** focus on response time and fairness.
