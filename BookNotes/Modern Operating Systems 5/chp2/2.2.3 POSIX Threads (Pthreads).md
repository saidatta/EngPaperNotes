The POSIX Threads (Pthreads) library is the standard thread API in UNIX-like systems, defined by **IEEE 1003.1c**. This API enables developers to write portable, multi-threaded programs. The API offers over 60 function calls, allowing fine-grained control of thread creation, management, and synchronization.

#### **Key Pthread Function Calls**

| **Function**           | **Description**                                              |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `pthread_create`        | Creates a new thread.                                        |
| `pthread_exit`          | Terminates the calling thread.                               |
| `pthread_join`          | Waits for a specific thread to exit.                         |
| `pthread_yield`         | Yields the CPU to allow another thread to run.               |
| `pthread_attr_init`     | Initializes a thread's attribute structure.                  |
| `pthread_attr_destroy`  | Destroys a thread's attribute structure to free memory.      |

### **Pthread Example in C**

Here's a simple example where we create 10 threads, each printing its identifier and then terminating.

```c
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#define NUMBER_OF_THREADS 10

// Thread function that prints the thread's ID
void *print_hello_world(void *tid) {
    printf("Hello World. Greetings from thread %d\n", (int) tid);
    pthread_exit(NULL);
}

int main() {
    pthread_t threads[NUMBER_OF_THREADS];
    int status;

    // Create 10 threads
    for (int i = 0; i < NUMBER_OF_THREADS; i++) {
        printf("Main: Creating thread %d\n", i);
        status = pthread_create(&threads[i], NULL, print_hello_world, (void *)i);

        if (status != 0) {
            printf("Oops. pthread_create returned error code %d\n", status);
            exit(-1);
        }
    }

    // Exit the main thread
    pthread_exit(NULL);
}
```

In this example:
- The main thread creates 10 threads, each executing the `print_hello_world` function.
- Each thread prints a message and terminates using `pthread_exit`.
- The order of execution is nondeterministic, and messages may appear in any order.

### **2.2.4 Implementing Threads in User Space**

Threads can be implemented in two places:
- **User space**: Threads are managed by a runtime library.
- **Kernel space**: Threads are managed by the kernel.

#### **User-Space Threads**

In a user-space implementation, the kernel is unaware of the existence of threads. The runtime library manages the threads, which can run on top of a single-threaded process from the kernel's point of view.

**Advantages of User-Space Threads:**
1. **Portability**: Threads can be implemented even on operating systems without native thread support.
2. **Fast Context Switches**: Switching between threads in user space is faster since it avoids kernel traps, context switches, and cache flushes.
3. **Custom Scheduling**: Applications can implement custom thread scheduling algorithms.

However, user-space threads come with major **disadvantages**:
1. **Blocking System Calls**: If a thread makes a blocking system call, it blocks the entire process, including all threads. One solution is using non-blocking I/O or wrapping system calls to check if they will block.
2. **Page Faults**: If a thread causes a page fault, the kernel blocks the entire process, stopping all threads.
3. **Lack of Preemption**: User-space threads cannot be preempted by a clock interrupt. A thread must yield control voluntarily using `pthread_yield`.

---

#### **Thread Table in User-Space Implementation**

Each process maintains a **thread table** in user space, analogous to the kernel's process table. This table stores thread-specific information such as:
- Program counter
- Stack pointer
- Register values
- Thread state (running, blocked, ready)

When a thread performs a blocking operation, its state is saved in the thread table, and a new thread is chosen to run.

```
+---------------------------------------------+
|          User-Space Thread Table            |
+---------------------------------------------+
| Thread ID | Program Counter | Stack Pointer |
|---------------------------------------------|
| Thread 1  |       0x4000     |     0x7ffd    |
| Thread 2  |       0x4100     |     0x7ff0    |
| Thread 3  |       0x4200     |     0x7fe0    |
+---------------------------------------------+
```

Thread switching in user space is handled entirely by the runtime system without kernel involvement.

---

### **Thread Switching in User Space**

Switching between user-space threads involves saving the state (e.g., program counter and registers) of the current thread and loading the state of the next thread from the thread table. In systems with instructions for saving and loading all registers, this switch can be extremely fastâ€”significantly faster than a kernel-level context switch.

**Example Pseudo-Code for Thread Switching:**
```
save_state(current_thread);
current_thread = scheduler.pick_next_thread();
load_state(current_thread);
```

**Advantages:**
- Fast switching (no kernel involvement).
- Custom scheduling is possible.

**Disadvantages:**
- Blocking system calls and page faults block the entire process.
- No clock interrupts to enforce preemptive multitasking.

---

### **Kernel-Level Threads**

In contrast, **kernel-level threads** are managed by the operating system kernel. The kernel is aware of all threads and performs the context switching between them.

```
+--------------------------------------------------+
|               Kernel-Level Threads               |
+--------------------------------------------------+
| Process ID | Thread ID | Program Counter | Stack |
|------------|-----------|----------------|-------|
|  1234      |    1      |    0x4000      |  0x7ffd |
|  1234      |    2      |    0x4100      |  0x7ff0 |
|  1235      |    1      |    0x4200      |  0x7fe0 |
+--------------------------------------------------+
```

In this approach, the kernel manages both the processes and the threads within them. 

**Advantages:**
1. **Preemptive Multitasking**: The kernel can use clock interrupts to preempt and switch between threads, ensuring that no thread runs indefinitely.
2. **Blocking I/O**: A blocked thread does not block the entire process; the kernel can switch to another thread while the first one waits for I/O.
3. **True Parallelism**: On multi-core systems, kernel-level threads can run on separate CPUs.

**Disadvantages:**
1. **Slower context switches**: Involves kernel traps, memory cache flushing, and other overhead.
2. **Scalability**: Kernel threads require more kernel resources (e.g., memory for stacks and scheduling tables).

### **POSIX Threads Example in Rust**

While Rust has its own threading model through the `std::thread` module, here is an equivalent Pthreads-style example using Rust to demonstrate thread creation and management.

```rust
use std::thread;

fn print_hello_world(thread_id: usize) {
    println!("Hello World. Greetings from thread {}", thread_id);
}

fn main() {
    let mut handles = vec![];

    for i in 0..10 {
        println!("Main here. Creating thread {}", i);
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            print_hello_world(i);
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }

    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }
}
```

This Rust example creates 10 threads, each calling the `print_hello_world` function. The main thread waits for each thread to finish using `join`.

### **Hybrid Threading**

Some systems adopt a **hybrid approach**, where user-level threads are multiplexed onto kernel-level threads. This allows applications to enjoy the flexibility of user-level threads while taking advantage of kernel-level preemptive multitasking.

---

### **Conclusion**

POSIX threads (Pthreads) provide a powerful and portable API for managing threads across UNIX-like systems. Threads can be implemented at the user level or in the kernel, each with advantages and disadvantages. Understanding the trade-offs between user-space and kernel-space threading is critical for designing efficient multi-threaded systems. 

For performance-critical or I/O-bound applications, leveraging kernel-level threads is often essential to avoid the blocking behavior of user-space threads. However, for lightweight tasks or systems with specific requirements, user-level threads can offer faster context switching and customizable scheduling.
