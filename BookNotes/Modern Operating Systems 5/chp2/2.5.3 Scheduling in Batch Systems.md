Scheduling in batch systems focuses on optimizing resource utilization since there is no immediate user interaction. The primary goal is to maximize throughput, minimize turnaround time, and keep the CPU as busy as possible. Below are various algorithms used in batch systems:

---

### **1. First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**

**First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)** is the simplest scheduling algorithm. It assigns the CPU to processes in the order they arrive. This is a non-preemptive algorithm, meaning once a process starts, it runs until completion.

#### **Characteristics**:
- **Non-preemptive**: Once a process starts, it cannot be interrupted.
- **Fair**: Processes are scheduled in the order they arrive.
- **Easy to implement**: Uses a queue to manage processes.
- **Downside**: Can lead to the **convoy effect**, where shorter processes are stuck behind long processes, leading to poor CPU utilization and I/O-bound process performance.

#### **Example**:

Consider the following processes arriving at the same time:

| Process | Burst Time (ms) |
|---------|-----------------|
| P1      | 6               |
| P2      | 8               |
| P3      | 7               |

The FCFS execution order is P1 → P2 → P3.

#### **Turnaround and Waiting Time Calculation**:

1. **P1** finishes at 6 ms.
2. **P2** finishes at 6 + 8 = 14 ms.
3. **P3** finishes at 14 + 7 = 21 ms.

Turnaround time (TAT) for each process:
- TAT(P1) = 6 ms
- TAT(P2) = 14 ms
- TAT(P3) = 21 ms

Average TAT = \( \frac{6 + 14 + 21}{3} = 13.67 \) ms

Waiting time (WT) for each process:
- WT(P1) = 0 ms
- WT(P2) = 6 ms (P2 starts after P1 finishes)
- WT(P3) = 14 ms (P3 starts after P2 finishes)

Average WT = \( \frac{0 + 6 + 14}{3} = 6.67 \) ms

---

### **2. Shortest Job First (SJF)**

**Shortest Job First (SJF)** selects the process with the shortest burst time for execution. This reduces the average waiting and turnaround times, making it optimal for batch systems.

#### **Characteristics**:
- **Non-preemptive**: Once a job is started, it runs to completion.
- **Provably Optimal**: Provides the minimum average waiting and turnaround times if all jobs are available simultaneously.
- **Downside**: It can lead to starvation for longer jobs if shorter jobs continuously arrive.

#### **Example**:

Consider the following jobs:

| Job | Burst Time (ms) |
|-----|-----------------|
| A   | 8               |
| B   | 4               |
| C   | 4               |
| D   | 4               |

Scheduling the jobs in **SJF** order (B → C → D → A):

1. **B** finishes at 4 ms.
2. **C** finishes at 4 + 4 = 8 ms.
3. **D** finishes at 8 + 4 = 12 ms.
4. **A** finishes at 12 + 8 = 20 ms.

Turnaround time:
- TAT(B) = 4 ms
- TAT(C) = 8 ms
- TAT(D) = 12 ms
- TAT(A) = 20 ms

Average TAT = \( \frac{4 + 8 + 12 + 20}{4} = 11 \) ms

Waiting time:
- WT(B) = 0 ms
- WT(C) = 4 ms
- WT(D) = 8 ms
- WT(A) = 12 ms

Average WT = \( \frac{0 + 4 + 8 + 12}{4} = 6 \) ms

### **3. Shortest Remaining Time Next (SRTN)**

**Shortest Remaining Time Next (SRTN)** is the preemptive version of SJF. In this algorithm, if a new process arrives with a shorter remaining time than the current process, the scheduler preempts the current process and runs the new process.

#### **Characteristics**:
- **Preemptive**: A running process can be interrupted if a new, shorter process arrives.
- **Optimal**: Minimizes the turnaround time for all processes.
- **Downside**: Can lead to starvation of long processes.

#### **Example**:

If a new process with a burst time of 3 ms arrives while a process with 5 ms remaining is running, the scheduler will preempt the current process and run the new process.

---

### **Scheduling in Interactive Systems**

In interactive systems, user requests need quick responses, and preemptive scheduling is essential to ensure fairness and responsiveness. Below are common algorithms for interactive systems:

---

### **1. Round-Robin (RR)**

**Round-Robin (RR)** scheduling is widely used in time-sharing systems. Each process gets a fixed time slice (quantum) to run. If it doesn't finish in that time, it is preempted, and the next process in the queue is scheduled.

#### **Characteristics**:
- **Preemptive**: Each process runs for a fixed time slice.
- **Fair**: Each process gets equal time in the CPU.
- **Quantum Size**: Choosing the right quantum size is crucial. A small quantum leads to frequent context switches (high overhead), while a large quantum increases response time for short tasks.

#### **Example**:

Consider three processes with the following burst times:

| Process | Burst Time (ms) |
|---------|-----------------|
| P1      | 24              |
| P2      | 3               |
| P3      | 3               |

If the time quantum is set to 4 ms:

1. **P1** runs for 4 ms, remaining burst = 20 ms.
2. **P2** finishes after 3 ms.
3. **P3** finishes after 3 ms.
4. **P1** runs for another 4 ms, remaining burst = 16 ms.
5. ...

#### **Rust Code Implementation for Round Robin**:

```rust
struct Process {
    id: usize,
    burst_time: usize,
}

fn round_robin(mut processes: Vec<Process>, quantum: usize) {
    let mut time = 0;
    while !processes.is_empty() {
        let mut new_processes = Vec::new();
        for mut process in processes {
            if process.burst_time > quantum {
                println!("Running process {} for {} ms", process.id, quantum);
                process.burst_time -= quantum;
                time += quantum;
                new_processes.push(process);
            } else {
                println!("Running process {} for {} ms", process.id, process.burst_time);
                time += process.burst_time;
                println!("Process {} finished", process.id);
            }
        }
        processes = new_processes;
    }
}

fn main() {
    let processes = vec![
        Process { id: 1, burst_time: 24 },
        Process { id: 2, burst_time: 3 },
        Process { id: 3, burst_time: 3 },
    ];
    let quantum = 4;
    round_robin(processes, quantum);
}
```

---

### **2. Priority Scheduling**

In **Priority Scheduling**, each process is assigned a priority, and the process with the highest priority is executed first. If two processes have the same priority, round-robin scheduling can be used to alternate between them.

#### **Characteristics**:
- **Preemptive or Non-preemptive**: Can be either. Preemptive priority scheduling interrupts a running process if a higher-priority process arrives.
- **Priority Inversion**: A low-priority process can block a higher-priority process, leading to **priority inversion**. To avoid this, **priority inheritance** can be used, where the lower-priority process temporarily inherits the higher priority.

#### **Rust Code Example**:

```rust
struct Process {
    id: usize,
    priority: usize,
    burst_time: usize,
}

fn priority_scheduling(mut processes: Vec<Process>) {
    // Sort by priority (higher priority runs first)
    processes.sort_by(|a, b| b.priority.cmp(&a.priority));
    for process in processes {
        println!("Running process {} with priority {}", process.id, process.priority);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let processes = vec![
        Process { id: 1, priority: 3, burst_time: 10 },
        Process { id: 2, priority: 1, burst_time: 5 },
        Process { id: 3, priority: 2, burst_time: 2 },
    ];
    priority_scheduling(processes);
}
```

#### **Priority Scheduling with Aging**:
- Aging prevents starvation by gradually increasing the priority of waiting processes over time. 

---

### **Conclusion**

Scheduling algorithms differ based on system requirements:
- **Batch systems** focus on maximizing throughput and minimizing turnaround time.
- **Interactive systems** prioritize responsiveness.
- **Real-time systems** ensure deadlines are met and processes run predictably.

The choice of algorithm depends on the system's goals and the type of processes being scheduled.
