This section delves into the design and structure of operating systems, with a specific focus on **processes** and **threads**, two foundational concepts in any modern OS. Processes and threads facilitate concurrency, multitasking, and resource management, even in systems with limited hardware.

---

### **2.1 Processes**

A **process** is the abstraction of a running program. It's essential to understand this concept, as it enables the OS to manage multiple tasks concurrently, even on single-core systems. Processes turn a single CPU into multiple virtual CPUs, allowing pseudo-parallelism.

#### **2.1.1 The Process Model**

The **process model** organizes the runnable software into **sequential processes**. These processes act like independent programs, each with its own state (registers, program counter, and variables). The OS switches between these processes, giving the illusion of parallelism, known as **multiprogramming**.

##### **Example: Multiprogramming in Rust**
```rust
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    let handles = vec![
        thread::spawn(|| {
            for _ in 1..5 {
                println!("Process A");
                thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(100));
            }
        }),
        thread::spawn(|| {
            for _ in 1..5 {
                println!("Process B");
                thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(200));
            }
        }),
    ];

    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }
}
```
- **Multiprogramming Concept**: Multiple processes (threads in Rust) share the CPU time and appear to run simultaneously, although at any point, only one is running on a single-core CPU.

#### **2.1.2 Process Creation**

Processes can be created by several events, including system initialization, user commands, and running system calls. There are **four principal events** that trigger process creation:
1. **System initialization**: Processes created when the system boots up.
2. **Execution of process-creation system calls**: A process creates another via system calls (e.g., `fork()` in UNIX).
3. **User requests**: Users create processes via commands or GUI interactions.
4. **Batch job initiation**: Processes created for batch jobs on large systems.

##### **UNIX Process Creation: `fork()` and `execve()`**

In UNIX-like systems, the `fork()` system call creates a **clone** of the parent process. The child process is typically followed by the `execve()` system call, which loads a new program into the childâ€™s memory.

```rust
use nix::unistd::{fork, ForkResult, execv};
use std::ffi::CString;

fn main() {
    match fork() {
        Ok(ForkResult::Parent { child, .. }) => {
            println!("Parent process: child process id = {}", child);
        }
        Ok(ForkResult::Child) => {
            let args: &[CString] = &[CString::new("ls").unwrap()];
            execv(&CString::new("/bin/ls").unwrap(), args).expect("Failed to execute command");
        }
        Err(_) => println!("Fork failed"),
    }
}
```
- **`fork()`** creates a new process (clone of the parent).
- **`execv()`** loads a new program (e.g., `ls`) into the child process.

---

#### **2.1.3 Process Termination**

Processes eventually terminate under one of the following conditions:
1. **Normal exit**: The process finishes its task and calls `exit()` or similar.
2. **Error exit**: The process encounters an error and exits voluntarily.
3. **Fatal error**: An unrecoverable error causes an involuntary termination (e.g., illegal memory access).
4. **Killed by another process**: One process may kill another (e.g., using `kill` in UNIX).

---

#### **2.1.4 Process Hierarchies**

In UNIX, processes form a **hierarchy** or **process tree**, where each process has a single parent but may have multiple children. The root of this tree is the `init` process, which manages system startup and user login processes.

##### **UNIX Process Hierarchy Example:**
```bash
$ ps -f
UID        PID  PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
root         1     0  0 12:00 ?        00:00:01 /sbin/init
root         2     1  0 12:00 ?        00:00:00 [kthreadd]
root         3     2  0 12:00 ?        00:00:00 [rcu_gp]
user      1001     1  0 12:00 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
user      1002  1001  0 12:01 pts/0    00:00:00 ps -f
```
- `PID`: Process ID.
- `PPID`: Parent Process ID. Each process has a parent, forming a hierarchy.
- `init` (PID 1) is the root of the process tree.

In contrast, Windows does not have a strict process hierarchy. All processes are treated equally, and a parent process can pass control to another process.

### **2.1.5 Process States**

Processes go through different states during their lifecycle:
1. **New**: The process is being created.
2. **Running**: Instructions are being executed.
3. **Blocked**: The process is waiting for some event (e.g., I/O completion).
4. **Ready**: The process is waiting to be assigned to a CPU.
5. **Terminated**: The process has finished execution.

---

### **2.1.6 Context Switching**

When switching from one process to another, the operating system must save the state of the old process and load the state of the new one. This is called **context switching**, and it involves saving and restoring the program counter, registers, and memory mappings.

##### **Context Switching Example in Rust**
Simulating context switching between two tasks using coroutines (lightweight processes):

```rust
use std::thread;
use std::sync::mpsc;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();

    let task_1 = thread::spawn(move || {
        for i in 0..5 {
            println!("Task 1 - iteration {}", i);
            tx.send(()).unwrap();
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(500));
        }
    });

    let task_2 = thread::spawn(move || {
        for i in 0..5 {
            rx.recv().unwrap();
            println!("Task 2 - iteration {}", i);
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(500));
        }
    });

    task_1.join().unwrap();
    task_2.join().unwrap();
}
```
In this example, **Task 1** and **Task 2** alternate their executions by sending and receiving messages through a channel, simulating a simplified version of context switching.

### **2.1.7 Process Control Block (PCB)**

Each process is represented by a **Process Control Block (PCB)**, which stores all the information about a process, such as:
- **Process ID (PID)**
- **Program Counter**
- **CPU registers**
- **Memory management information**
- **I/O status**

---

### **2.2 Threads**

While processes are isolated from each other, threads are lightweight processes that share the same memory space within a process. This makes threads faster for certain tasks, such as handling concurrent I/O.

- **Threads vs. Processes**: 
  - Threads share memory and resources, making them cheaper to create and switch between.
  - Processes have separate address spaces, which provide more isolation but involve higher overhead during context switches.

##### **Thread Example in Rust**
```rust
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let handle = thread::spawn(|| {
        for i in 1..10 {
            println!("Hello from thread {}", i);
        }
    });

    for i in 1..5 {
        println!("Hello from main thread {}", i);
    }

    handle.join().unwrap();
}
```
This example demonstrates basic thread creation and management in Rust, showing parallel execution of a thread and the main process.

### **Equations and Concepts**

1. **CPU Utilization in Multiprogramming**:
   - Let **p** be the fraction of time a process spends waiting (e.g., for I/O).
   - For **n** processes, the probability that the CPU is idle is \( p^n \).
   - **CPU Utilization**: 
     \[
     U = 1 - p^n
     \]
     As **n** increases, CPU utilization improves.

2. **Process Scheduling**:
   - **Round Robin Scheduling** is one of the simplest scheduling algorithms:
     \[
     \text{Turnaround time} = \frac{\text{Total execution time}}{\text{Number of processes}}
     \]
   - **Preemptive Scheduling**: A process can be interrupted to allow another to run, enhancing response time but adding overhead.

---

### **Conclusion**

Processes and threads are the fundamental abstractions that make modern multitasking operating systems possible. Understanding their life cycles, interactions, and management allows for efficient system design and optimizes the execution of concurrent applications.
