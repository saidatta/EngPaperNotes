In multithreaded environments, locks are often used to ensure consistency when multiple threads read and write shared data structures. However, locks can introduce problems like **priority inversion** and **deadlocks**. The solution is to avoid locks altogether where possible, and **Read-Copy-Update (RCU)** is one such strategy that allows for concurrent read and write accesses without traditional locks.

##### **RCU Concept Overview**

The goal of RCU is to allow readers to access data structures concurrently while writers update those data structures without blocking the readers. RCU works by ensuring that readers see either the old or the new version of the data but never a partially updated or inconsistent version. This is done by:

1. **Making Changes in the Background**: Writers create a new version of the data and only expose it to readers when it is fully constructed. This guarantees that readers always see consistent data.
   
2. **Delaying Deallocation**: After updating the data structure, the old version must be kept around until all readers finish their tasks. Only then is the old data freed.

##### **How RCU Works: Tree Example**

Consider a tree structure that needs to be updated concurrently. Here's an example:

1. **Initial State**: A tree consists of nodes A, B, C, D, and E.
2. **Inserting a Node (X)**: A new node X is inserted. The writer prepares the node by setting up all its properties and links to other nodes. Once it’s ready, the writer makes X a child of node A with an **atomic update**. Readers in the middle of traversal may continue to see the old tree (without X), while new readers see the tree with node X.
3. **Removing Nodes (B and D)**: When nodes B and D are removed, readers that are already traversing through B or D continue to see the old version, while new readers avoid B and D by following updated pointers.
4. **Memory Reclamation**: To ensure safe deletion, RCU introduces the concept of a **grace period**—a time window during which all readers that could have seen B and D finish their work. Only after this grace period can B and D be safely deallocated.

##### **Grace Period and Synchronization**

A **grace period** is defined as a time frame during which all threads must pass through a **context switch** or a **quiescent state** (i.e., not in the read-side critical section). Once this grace period has passed, it is safe to reclaim memory.

##### **Rust Implementation: Read-Copy-Update (RCU)**

Here's a simplified RCU implementation using Rust:

```rust
use std::sync::{Arc, RwLock};
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    left: Option<Arc<RwLock<Node>>>,
    right: Option<Arc<RwLock<Node>>>,
}

impl Node {
    fn new(value: i32) -> Self {
        Node { value, left: None, right: None }
    }
}

fn main() {
    // Root node
    let root = Arc::new(RwLock::new(Node::new(10)));

    // Reader thread: reading the tree
    let reader_root = Arc::clone(&root);
    let reader_thread = thread::spawn(move || {
        loop {
            let node = reader_root.read().unwrap();
            println!("Reader: Node value is {}", node.value);
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(100)); // Simulate reading
        }
    });

    // Writer thread: inserting a new node
    let writer_root = Arc::clone(&root);
    let writer_thread = thread::spawn(move || {
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(1)); // Delay to allow readers
        let mut node = writer_root.write().unwrap();
        node.right = Some(Arc::new(RwLock::new(Node::new(20))));
        println!("Writer: Inserted new node with value 20");
    });

    reader_thread.join().unwrap();
    writer_thread.join().unwrap();
}
```

##### **Key Points in the Code**:
- Readers use **read locks** (`RwLock`) to access the tree concurrently.
- Writers use **write locks** to update the tree atomically.
- Readers and writers do not block each other.
