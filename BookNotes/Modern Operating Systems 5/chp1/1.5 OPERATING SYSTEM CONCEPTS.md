### **Overview**
Operating systems provide core abstractions such as **processes**, **address spaces**, and **files**. Understanding these concepts is essential for comprehending how an operating system functions, particularly in managing resources and execution of programs. This section offers a detailed breakdown of these abstractions with practical Rust code examples, equations, and ASCII diagrams for deeper insight.

---
### **1.5.1 Processes**
#### **Concept**
A **process** is essentially a program in execution, accompanied by an **address space**, which contains:
- The executable program
- Program data
- Stack for managing function calls

Each process also maintains **resources** such as:
- CPU registers (including the program counter and stack pointer)
- Open files
- Timers
- Pointers to child processes
- Other necessary metadata (e.g., UID, GID)

Processes interact with other processes through **interprocess communication** (IPC), which allows coordination and resource sharing.

---

#### **Process Lifecycle**
Processes can be created by a **parent process** that spawns **child processes**, forming a **process tree**.

```
           ┌── Process A ──┬── Process B ──┬── Process D
           │               │               ├── Process E
           │               │               └── Process F
           │               └── Process C
```

Processes can be in one of several states:
1. **Running**: Actively executing on the CPU.
2. **Blocked**: Waiting for an event (I/O completion, etc.).
3. **Suspended**: Temporarily halted, saving its state.
4. **Terminated**: Finished execution or killed.

**Example: Forking a process in Rust**
```rust
use std::process::Command;

fn main() {
    // Spawning a child process
    let child = Command::new("echo")
        .arg("Hello, world!")
        .spawn()
        .expect("Failed to execute process");

    println!("Child process spawned with PID: {}", child.id());
}
```
In this example, a child process is created using the Rust standard library. The **spawn()** function starts a process asynchronously, and **id()** fetches the process ID.

#### **Process Table**
The **Process Table** stores metadata about each process, such as:
- Program counter
- Stack pointer
- Registers
- Open files
- Current state (e.g., running, blocked, etc.)

---

#### **Context Switching**
When an operating system switches between processes, it performs **context switching**, which involves saving the current process state (registers, program counter, etc.) and loading the state of the next process.

```
┌───────────────────┐
│ Running Process A  │
├───────────────────┤
│ Save A’s State     │  ← Save current state in Process Table
├───────────────────┤
│ Load B’s State     │  ← Load next process’s state from Process Table
├───────────────────┤
│ Running Process B  │
└───────────────────┘
```

Context switches are computationally expensive since they involve saving/restoring large amounts of data.

---

#### **Signal Handling**
Signals allow processes to handle asynchronous events, such as timers expiring or hardware interrupts. When a signal is received, the process temporarily suspends, handles the signal, and then resumes execution.

**Example: Signal Handling in Rust**
```rust
use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicBool, Ordering};
use signal_hook::consts::signal::*;
use signal_hook::iterator::Signals;

static RUNNING: AtomicBool = AtomicBool::new(true);

fn main() {
    let mut signals = Signals::new(&[SIGTERM, SIGINT]).expect("Failed to register signals");
    for signal in signals.forever() {
        match signal {
            SIGTERM | SIGINT => {
                println!("Received termination signal");
                RUNNING.store(false, Ordering::Relaxed);
                break;
            },
            _ => unreachable!(),
        }
    }
}
```

This Rust code listens for termination signals (`SIGTERM`, `SIGINT`) and safely shuts down the process when a signal is caught.

### **1.5.2 Address Spaces**

#### **Concept**
An **address space** is the range of memory addresses a process can reference. Every process has a separate address space, which includes the code, data, and stack of the program.

#### **Virtual Memory**
Modern operating systems use **virtual memory** to provide the illusion of a large, contiguous address space. Virtual memory allows processes to use more memory than physically available by storing parts of the address space on disk and swapping it in/out as needed.

```
Virtual Memory Layout (Simplified)

  +-------------------------------+  Address 0
  |       Program Code             |
  +-------------------------------+  ↑ Stack grows
  |       Program Data             |
  +-------------------------------+
  |           Stack                |  ↓
  +-------------------------------+  Maximum Address
```

#### **Address Translation (Virtual to Physical)**
The OS translates virtual addresses to physical addresses using a **page table**. Pages are fixed-size blocks of memory (typically 4KB) that map virtual addresses to physical addresses.

```
Virtual Address → Page Table → Physical Address

  +------------+     +------------+     +------------+
  | Virtual    |     | Page Table |     | Physical   |
  | Address    |     | Entry      |     | Address    |
  +------------+     +------------+     +------------+
      0x001               0x0001           0x12345
```

---

#### **Page Faults**
If a process references an address that is not in memory, the OS triggers a **page fault**, which fetches the missing data from disk into memory.

**Equation for Page Fault Rate**:
\[
\text{Page Fault Rate} = \frac{\text{Page Faults}}{\text{Total Memory Accesses}}
\]

A lower page fault rate indicates better memory performance.

---

#### **Example: Memory Mapping in Rust**
Rust’s `mmap` crate can be used to simulate memory mapping of files, providing insight into virtual memory concepts.

```rust
use std::fs::File;
use memmap::Mmap;

fn main() {
    let file = File::open("example.txt").expect("Failed to open file");
    let mmap = unsafe { Mmap::map(&file).expect("Failed to map file") };
    
    println!("File content: {:?}", &mmap[..]);
}
```

This code demonstrates mapping a file into memory, which effectively simulates reading from virtual memory.

---

### **Conclusion**
- **Processes** are central to OS functionality, responsible for managing the execution state of programs.
- **Address spaces** abstract physical memory, allowing efficient memory management and multi-process execution.
- OS concepts like **context switching**, **signals**, and **virtual memory** are key to understanding process management and memory protection.

By implementing the provided Rust examples, engineers can gain a practical understanding of these operating system abstractions, as well as their critical role in modern computing environments.
