#### **Historical Development of Hardware and Software**

The evolution of computer systems is deeply intertwined with hardware capabilities, particularly memory size. Early systems, such as the IBM 7090/7094 (1959-1964), had just over **128 KB** of memory, making programming languages like assembly essential to conserve memory. As hardware improved, so did the languages, with high-level languages like **FORTRAN** and **COBOL** becoming prominent.

##### **Memory Evolution Timeline**
- **IBM 7090/7094 (1959-1964)**: 128 KB memory, primarily programmed in assembly language.
- **PDP-1**: Minicomputers with 4096 18-bit words, bringing back assembly language due to limited memory.
- **Microcomputers (1980s)**: Initial systems with 4 KB of memory, also reverting to assembly for memory efficiency.
- **Modern Systems**: Today, personal computers have large amounts of memory and are commonly programmed in **C**, **C++**, **Java**, and **Python**.

##### **Rust Code: Memory Usage Example**
Here's an example of allocating and manipulating large amounts of memory in Rust:

```rust
fn main() {
    // Allocate 1 GB of memory using a vector
    let mut large_vec = vec![0u8; 1024 * 1024 * 1024];
    
    // Modify some memory locations
    for i in 0..large_vec.len() {
        large_vec[i] = (i % 256) as u8;
    }
    
    println!("Memory allocated and modified!");
}
```

This code demonstrates how modern systems can easily handle large memory allocations due to increased RAM and efficient memory management techniques.

### **Protection Hardware**

#### **Introduction of Protection Hardware**
Early mainframes lacked **protection hardware**, meaning they could only run one program at a time. If a program crashed, it could wipe out the entire system. The IBM 360 introduced primitive hardware protection, enabling **multiprogramming** by allowing several programs to reside in memory simultaneously and take turns running. 

Key protection concepts include:
- **Memory isolation**: Preventing one process from accessing the memory of another.
- **Privileged modes**: Kernel mode vs. user mode, restricting direct access to hardware resources.

##### **Memory Protection Example in Rust**
While Rust cannot directly implement hardware-level memory protection, it does provide strong guarantees through its **ownership model** and **borrow checker**, which prevent illegal memory access.

```rust
use std::cell::RefCell;

fn main() {
    let shared_data = RefCell::new(5);
    
    {
        let mut data = shared_data.borrow_mut();
        *data += 1;
    } // The mutable borrow ends here, ensuring no data races.

    println!("Shared data: {:?}", shared_data);
}
```

In this code, Rust enforces memory protection at compile time, ensuring no two references can modify the same data simultaneously, mimicking hardware-level memory protection.

### **Disks**

#### **The Evolution of Disk Storage**
Initially, computers used **magnetic tapes** for storage, which were sequential and lacked random access. This changed with the introduction of IBM's **RAMAC** in 1956, the first hard disk drive capable of random access.

Key points in disk evolution:
- **RAMAC (1956)**: 5 MB of storage across 50 disks, costing around $35,000 annually.
- **PDP-11 (1970)**: Introduced the **RK05** disk with 2.5 MB capacity.
- **Modern Storage**: Today, SSDs provide several terabytes of storage with extremely fast access times.

##### **Rust Example: Reading from a File (Disk I/O)**
```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{self, Read};

fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
    let mut file = File::open("example.txt")?;
    let mut contents = String::new();
    file.read_to_string(&mut contents)?;
    println!("File contents: {}", contents);
    Ok(())
}
```

This example shows basic disk I/O operations in Rust, demonstrating how modern operating systems abstract physical disks with file systems.

### **Virtual Memory**

#### **Introduction to Virtual Memory**
Virtual memory allows programs to use more memory than physically available by swapping parts of the program in and out of **RAM** from **stable storage** (disks or SSDs). The main benefit is that programs can run regardless of the actual physical memory limitations.

##### **Virtual Memory Mechanisms**:
- **Paging**: Divides memory into fixed-size pages (usually 4 KB) that can be swapped between RAM and disk.
- **Segmentation**: Divides memory into segments of varying sizes based on logical divisions like code, data, and stack.
- **Page Tables**: Data structures used by the OS to map virtual addresses to physical addresses.

##### **Equation: Page Fault Rate**
\[
\text{Page Fault Rate} = \frac{\text{Number of Page Faults}}{\text{Total Memory Accesses}}
\]
A high page fault rate indicates that the system is frequently accessing memory that has been swapped to disk, which degrades performance.

##### **Rust Example: Simulating Virtual Memory with Vectors**
```rust
const PAGE_SIZE: usize = 4096;

fn main() {
    let mut memory: Vec<u8> = vec![0; PAGE_SIZE * 10]; // 10 pages of memory
    // Simulate accessing memory beyond physical RAM
    memory[PAGE_SIZE * 9] = 1;
    println!("Simulated access to virtual memory.");
}
```

This code simulates virtual memory behavior using a vector, where memory is allocated in blocks (pages).

### **System Calls**

#### **Introduction to System Calls**
System calls are the interface between **user programs** and the **operating system**. When a program needs to perform operations such as file I/O, process management, or networking, it makes system calls to request the OS to perform those operations on its behalf.

System calls provide:
- **Abstractions**: For resources like files, processes, and memory.
- **Controlled Access**: To system resources, ensuring only authorized operations are performed.

##### **The System Call Process**
1. **User Program** prepares parameters and makes a call to a system library function (e.g., `read()`).
2. The library function issues a **trap** to switch the CPU from **user mode** to **kernel mode**.
3. The OS processes the request, interacts with hardware if necessary, and then returns the result to the user program.
4. Control is passed back to the user program, which resumes execution.

##### **Rust Example: Using System Calls (File I/O)**
```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::prelude::*;

fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    let mut file = File::open("example.txt")?;
    let mut contents = String::new();
    file.read_to_string(&mut contents)?;
    println!("File contents: {}", contents);
    Ok(())
}
```

Here, the `open()` function is a wrapper around a system call, invoking the operating system to read a file.

#### **System Call Steps (Detailed View)**
Let's break down a **read** system call as an example. The system call involves these steps:

```
User Space                                      Kernel Space
----------                                      ------------
1. Prepare parameters (file descriptor,         6. Kernel executes the trap and identifies
   buffer, and number of bytes)                    the requested system call.
2. Call the read() library function.            7. Dispatch to the system call handler.
3. Trap to the kernel.                          8. System call handler reads data from disk.
4. OS switches to kernel mode.                  9. Data is copied to user buffer.
5. Kernel retrieves parameters from registers. 10. Control returns to the user space.
```

This process ensures safe, controlled access to system resources.
