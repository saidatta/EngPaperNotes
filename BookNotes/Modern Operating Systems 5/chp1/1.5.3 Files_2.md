#### **Introduction**
The **file system** is a core concept in virtually every operating system, abstracting away the complexities of hardware devices like SSDs and hard drives, and providing a clean interface for programmers to interact with files. Files represent a persistent store of data, which can be created, read, written, and deleted using system calls.

#### **File System Organization**
A typical file system is hierarchical, organized as a **tree** where directories (also called folders) contain files and other directories. This hierarchical organization simplifies data management by grouping related files together. Below is a basic representation:

```
/ (root)
├── Faculty
│   └── Prof.Brown
│       └── Courses
│           └── CS101
├── Students
└── Admin
```

Here, `/Faculty/Prof.Brown/Courses/CS101` is an **absolute path** to a file, starting from the root directory (`/`).

#### **Basic File Operations**
- **Creating**: Allocating space for a new file.
- **Reading**: Retrieving data from a file.
- **Writing**: Modifying or appending data to a file.
- **Deleting**: Removing the file and freeing up the space.

##### **Rust Example: File Creation and Reading**
```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{self, Write, Read};

fn main() -> io::Result<()> {
    // Create a new file and write data to it
    let mut file = File::create("example.txt")?;
    file.write_all(b"Hello, world!")?;

    // Read the data back from the file
    let mut file = File::open("example.txt")?;
    let mut content = String::new();
    file.read_to_string(&mut content)?;
    println!("File content: {}", content);

    Ok(())
}
```

This Rust code demonstrates the creation of a file, writing data to it, and reading the data back. System calls handle the file I/O operations behind the scenes, abstracting away the underlying hardware complexities.

#### **Directories and Paths**
- **Directory**: A file that contains references to other files or directories.
- **Absolute Path**: A path starting from the root directory (e.g., `/Faculty/Prof.Brown`).
- **Relative Path**: A path relative to the current working directory (e.g., `Courses/CS101` when the working directory is `/Faculty/Prof.Brown`).

#### **File Descriptors**
When a file is opened, the operating system assigns a **file descriptor**, which is an integer used to reference the file during operations. Each process has its own set of file descriptors.

**Rust Example: Working with File Descriptors**
```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::os::unix::io::AsRawFd;

fn main() {
    let file = File::open("example.txt").unwrap();
    println!("File descriptor: {}", file.as_raw_fd());
}
```
Here, the `as_raw_fd()` method provides access to the low-level file descriptor associated with an open file.

#### **Mounted File Systems**
Unix-like systems support the **mounting** of file systems from external storage devices (like USB drives) into the existing directory structure. This allows for seamless access to files from multiple devices.

```
Before Mounting:
  / (root)
  ├── home
  ├── var
  └── (USB drive is separate)

After Mounting:
  / (root)
  ├── home
  ├── var
  └── usb (mounted here)
      ├── file1
      └── file2
```

#### **Special Files**
Unix introduces **special files** to represent hardware devices. These files are located in `/dev` and can be block or character devices:
- **Block Special Files**: Represent devices like hard drives, which can be accessed in blocks.
- **Character Special Files**: Represent devices like keyboards or printers, which operate on character streams.

### **1.5.4 Input/Output**

#### **Overview**
Operating systems manage I/O devices such as keyboards, monitors, printers, and disk drives. The **I/O subsystem** is responsible for:
- **Device Independence**: Allowing devices to be accessed uniformly.
- **Device Drivers**: Providing a specific interface for each hardware device.

#### **Device Independence**
The operating system abstracts I/O devices, allowing the same system calls to read from a file or a keyboard.

**Example: Read from stdin (Keyboard)**
```rust
use std::io::{self, Read};

fn main() {
    let mut input = String::new();
    io::stdin().read_to_string(&mut input).unwrap();
    println!("You typed: {}", input);
}
```

In this Rust example, the standard input device is abstracted as a file, and reading from the keyboard works the same way as reading from a file.

---

### **1.5.5 Protection**

#### **Overview**
Operating systems protect resources and ensure that data is accessed only by authorized users. UNIX uses a **9-bit protection code** for files, with separate permissions for the owner, group members, and others:
- **rwx**: Read, write, and execute permissions.
- Example: `rwxr-x--x` means:
  - Owner can read, write, and execute.
  - Group members can read and execute.
  - Others can only execute.

#### **File Permissions in UNIX**
The protection bits are set during file creation or modified using commands like `chmod`. In Rust, you can modify permissions using the `set_permissions()` function.

**Example: Setting File Permissions in Rust**
```rust
use std::fs::{File, Permissions};
use std::os::unix::fs::PermissionsExt;

fn main() {
    let file = File::create("example.txt").unwrap();
    let permissions = Permissions::from_mode(0o755); // rwxr-xr-x
    file.set_permissions(permissions).unwrap();
}
```

#### **Additional Security**
Beyond file permissions, modern systems use other security mechanisms, such as encryption, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems, to protect resources from unauthorized access and cyberattacks.

### **1.5.6 The Shell**

#### **Overview**
The **shell** is a command-line interpreter that serves as the primary interface between the user and the operating system. It allows users to execute system calls interactively. Popular shells include `bash`, `zsh`, and `sh`.

#### **Basic Shell Operations**
1. **Command Execution**: The shell reads a command, creates a process to execute it, and waits for it to complete.
2. **Redirection**: Output and input streams can be redirected to files or devices.

**Example: Redirection in Rust**
```rust
use std::process::Command;

fn main() {
    Command::new("ls")
        .arg("-l")
        .output()
        .expect("Failed to execute command");
}
```
Here, we execute the `ls` command using the Rust `Command` module, which abstracts the underlying shell operation.

#### **Pipes**
**Pipes** allow communication between processes, where the output of one process becomes the input of another. This creates a seamless data flow between different programs.

```
Process A (Output) → Pipe → Process B (Input)
```

**Example: Pipes in Rust**
```rust
use std::process::{Command, Stdio};

fn main() {
    let mut echo = Command::new("echo")
        .arg("Hello, world!")
        .stdout(Stdio::piped())
        .spawn()
        .unwrap();

    let output = Command::new("grep")
        .arg("world")
        .stdin(echo.stdout.take().unwrap())
        .output()
        .unwrap();

    println!("{}", String::from_utf8_lossy(&output.stdout));
}
```

This example connects the output of the `echo` command to the input of the `grep` command using a pipe.

### **1.5.7 Ontogeny Recapitulates Phylogeny**

#### **Concept**
This analogy compares the development of new technologies with the evolution of species. Just as species evolve, computing technologies cycle through phases of innovation, becoming obsolete only to be revived by new advancements. For instance, early computers used **hardwired instruction sets**, which became obsolete with **microprogramming**. Later, **RISC architectures** made direct execution dominant again, but now microprogramming is resurfacing to allow updates for security vulnerabilities.

#### **Technological Cycles in OS Development**
- **Direct Execution vs. Interpretation**: Early CPUs used direct execution. Microprogramming replaced it for flexibility, but direct execution became favorable again with RISC. Now, microprogramming is making a comeback due to its ability to patch hardware vulnerabilities like **Spectre** and **Meltdown**.
  
**Equation of CPU Time**:
\[
T_{\text{CPU}} = I \times C \times T_{\text{cycle}}
\]
Where:
- \( I \) is the number of instructions.
- \( C \) is the cycles per instruction.
- \( T_{\text{cycle}} \) is the cycle time of the CPU.

Changes in technology, such as faster memory or CPU, directly impact this equation, leading to shifts in architectural trends.

---

### **Conclusion**
Operating system concepts like **file systems**, **I/O**, **protection**, and **shells** form the backbone of modern computing environments. These abstractions simplify interaction with hardware, ensure data protection, and facilitate communication between processes. The cyclical nature of technological advancements means that what may seem obsolete today could become
