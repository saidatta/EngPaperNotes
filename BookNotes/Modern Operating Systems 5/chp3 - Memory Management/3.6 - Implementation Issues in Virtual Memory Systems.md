#### Overview
Implementation of virtual memory systems involves several key activities at different stages of a process's lifecycle, including process creation, execution, handling page faults, and process termination. Each stage has its own set of challenges and requirements.

#### 1. Process Creation
- **Initial Setup**: Determine the size of program and data, create and initialize a page table.
- **Memory Allocation**: Allocate space in memory for the page table and initialize swap space on nonvolatile storage.
- **Swap Area Preparation**: Initialize the swap area with program text and data for future page faults.
- **Page Table Management**: Maintain information about the page table and swap area in the process table.
- **Handling Executable Files**: Optionally, page program text directly from the executable file to save space and initialization time.

#### 2. Process Execution
- **MMU Setup**: Reset the Memory Management Unit (MMU) for the new process.
- **TLB Management**: If necessary, flush the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) to remove entries from the previous process.
- **Page Table Activation**: Make the process's page table current, either by copying it or a pointer to it into a hardware register.
- **Optional Prepaging**: Load some or all pages into memory to reduce initial page faults.

#### 3. Page Fault Handling
- **Fault Identification**: Determine which virtual page is needed based on hardware registers or by analyzing the faulting instruction.
- **Page Selection and Validation**: Check the address validity and protection. If invalid, signal or terminate the process.
- **Frame Allocation**: Choose a free page frame or select a victim page if none are free.
- **Disk Operations**: If necessary, schedule dirty pages for transfer to nonvolatile storage and load the required page from disk/SSD.
- **Page Table Update**: After page arrival, update page tables and change frame status.
- **Instruction Restart**: Back up the faulting instruction to its initial state and reset the program counter.
- **Process Resumption**: Resume the faulting process, allowing it to continue execution.

#### 4. Process Termination
- **Resource Release**: Free the process's page table, pages, and swap space on nonvolatile storage.
- **Shared Page Management**: Handle shared pages with care to avoid releasing pages still in use by other processes.

#### Detailed Page Fault Handling Procedure
1. **Hardware Trap**: Save program counter and state information.
2. **Save Volatile Data**: Use an assembly-code routine to preserve volatile data and call the page fault handler.
3. **Identify Faulting Page**: Analyze CPU registers or faulting instruction to identify the required page.
4. **Address and Protection Check**: Verify address validity and access protection.
5. **Frame Selection and Cleaning**: Choose a page frame, clean it if dirty, and mark as busy.
6. **Page Loading**: Schedule disk/SSD operation to load the needed page.
7. **Update and Restart**: Update page tables, reset the faulting instruction, and prepare for process resumption.
8. **Resume Process**: Return control to the faulting process to continue execution.
