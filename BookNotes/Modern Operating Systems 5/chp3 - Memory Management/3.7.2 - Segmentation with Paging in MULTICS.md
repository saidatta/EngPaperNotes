#### Overview
MULTICS was a pioneering operating system that combined segmentation with paging, influencing many modern systems including the Intel x86 architecture. This note explores its memory management approach, which allowed for efficient use of large and variable-sized segments through paging.
#### Key Concepts
1. **Segmented Virtual Memory**:
   - MULTICS provided up to 218 segments per program, each segment being up to 65,536 words in length.
   - Segments were treated as individual virtual memories and were paged, allowing for part usage without full memory occupation.

2. **Segment Table** (Refer to Fig. 3-34):
   - Each program had a segment table, with each entry containing segment details like presence in memory, size, protection bits, etc.
   - The segment table was paged and each descriptor indicated if its segment was in memory.

3. **Address Structure** (Refer to Fig. 3-35):
   - A MULTICS address was divided into segment number, page number within the segment, and offset within the page.

4. **Address Translation Process** (Refer to Fig. 3-36):
   - The segment number was used to locate the segment descriptor.
   - The page number led to the appropriate page table entry.
   - Finally, the word was accessed by adding the offset to the page origin.

5. **Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB)** (Refer to Fig. 3-37):
   - A key feature in MULTICS, the TLB accelerated address translation by caching recently used addresses.
   - It contained 16 entries and could parallelly search for a given virtual address.

#### Advantages of MULTICS System
1. **Combining Segmentation and Paging**: This approach allowed for logical separation of program parts (segments) with efficient memory usage (paging).
2. **Flexibility in Memory Management**: Segments could grow or shrink independently, optimizing memory usage.
3. **Efficient Address Translation**: The use of TLBs significantly sped up the address translation process.

#### Implementation Challenges and Solutions
1. **Checkerboarding and Compaction** (Refer to Fig. 3-33):
   - External fragmentation or checkerboarding was a challenge due to variable segment sizes.
   - Compaction was employed to rearrange memory and reduce fragmentation.
2. **Dynamic Segment and Page Management**:
   - Dynamically managing segment tables and paging to accommodate varying segment sizes and usage patterns.

#### Impact and Legacy
1. **Influence on Future Systems**: MULTICS influenced several key areas in computing, including operating systems like UNIX, memory architectures, and TLB design.
2. **Longevity and Relevance**: The ideas and implementations from MULTICS remained relevant for decades, showcasing their innovation and effectiveness.
