### Question
If a computer system has enough room to hold four programs in its main memory, and each program is idle waiting for I/O 50% of the time, what fraction of CPU time is wasted?
### Answer
To determine the fraction of CPU time that is wasted, we need to consider the probability that all four programs are idle simultaneously. Each program independently waits for I/O 50% of the time, so the probability of one program being idle at any given moment is 0.5.
### Mathematical Analysis
1. **Probability of a single program being idle**: \( P(\text{idle}) = 0.5 \)
2. **Probability of all four programs being idle at the same time**:
   $P(\text{all idle}) = P(\text{idle})^4 = 0.5^4 = \frac{1}{16}$
This result means that the CPU is idle (wasted) 1/16 of the time.

### Explanation with Example Code (Rust-like Pseudocode)
```rust
fn main() {
    let num_programs = 4;
    let p_idle = 0.5;

    // Calculate probability of all programs being idle simultaneously
    let cpu_wastage = p_idle.powi(num_programs);
    println!("Fraction of CPU time wasted: {:.2}", cpu_wastage);
}
```
### Key Points:
- **CPU Wastage Calculation**:
  - The CPU time is wasted when all programs are waiting for I/O.
  - Probability of all four programs being idle simultaneously: $\( \frac{1}{16} \)$ or 6.25%.
- **Assumptions**:
  - Each program is idle independently and has a 50% chance of waiting for I/O.
  - No additional factors influence the CPU's utilization outside of the I/O wait time.
### Conclusion:
Given that each program is independently idle 50% of the time, the CPU wastes 6.25% of its time when all four programs are waiting for I/O at the same time.
