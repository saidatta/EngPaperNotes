### Question
Why do modern operating systems use separate kernel stacks when handling interrupts or system calls?
### Answer
When an interrupt or system call transfers control to the operating system, a separate kernel stack is used to maintain the OS's stability and security. This separate kernel stack ensures an isolated execution context, preventing interference with the user process's stack, which may be in an inconsistent state. It allows the kernel to handle system calls and interrupts securely while safeguarding sensitive data from user-level processes. The kernel stack provides a reliable space for managing process states, supporting nested interrupts, and ensuring consistent system behavior.

### Code Example: Handling an Interrupt in Rust-like Pseudocode
```rust
// Hypothetical context switch to handle an interrupt
fn handle_interrupt() {
    // Save the current process state and switch to the kernel stack
    save_process_state();
    switch_to_kernel_stack();

    // Execute the interrupt handler using the kernel stack
    process_interrupt();

    // Restore the user stack and process state after handling
    restore_process_state();
    switch_back_to_user_stack();
}

// Pseudo-functions for the context switch
fn save_process_state() {
    // Save registers, program counter, etc.
}

fn switch_to_kernel_stack() {
    // Switch to the process-specific kernel stack
}

fn process_interrupt() {
    // Perform the interrupt handling logic here
}

fn restore_process_state() {
    // Restore registers, program counter, etc.
}

fn switch_back_to_user_stack() {
    // Switch back to the user stack after handling
}
```

### Key Points:
- **Isolation and Security**: Ensures the OS's stack remains protected and unmodified by user processes.
- **Consistency**: Prevents user-mode stack inconsistencies during kernel operations.
- **Nesting**: Safely handles nested interrupts without corrupting process states.
- **Protection**: Kernel stacks are inaccessible to user-mode processes, safeguarding system integrity.

In summary, kernel stacks create a protected and reliable context for executing critical OS operations, ensuring system stability and efficient process management.
