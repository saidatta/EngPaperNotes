* ### Question. 
* In Fig. 2-2, three process states are shown. In theory, with three states, there could be six transitions, two out of each state. However, only four transitions are shown. Are there any circumstances in which either or both of the missing transitions might occur?
* ### Answer
* Yes, there are circumstances in which the missing transitions between the process states—specifically, the transitions from **Ready to Blocked** and from **Blocked to Running**—might occur.
* ### **Transition from Ready to Blocked**
	* **Direct Transition without Running:** Although uncommon, a process in the **Ready** state might transition directly to the **Blocked** state without actually running. This can happen in systems where processes in the ready queue must perform certain checks before execution.
	- **Examples:**
	  1. **Resource Availability Check:** Before a process begins execution, it might need to ensure that required resources are available. If these resources are not available, the process cannot proceed and transitions to the **Blocked** state to wait for the resources.
	     - *Scenario:* A process requires access to a specific device or file that is currently in use. Upon being scheduled, it checks for availability, finds it unavailable, and moves to the blocked state to wait.
	  2. **Priority Inversion Handling:** In some priority-based scheduling systems, a lower-priority process in the ready queue might be prevented from running due to higher-priority processes needing shared resources. It might be moved to the blocked state to wait until the higher-priority processes have finished.
	  3. **Event Wait Condition:** A process might be designed to wait for a specific event that it checks before execution. If the event has not occurred yet, it moves from **Ready** to **Blocked**.
### **Transition from Blocked to Running**
**Explanation:**
- **Immediate Execution upon Unblocking:** A process in the **Blocked** state becomes **Ready** when the event it's waiting for occurs. If the CPU is idle or the process has higher priority than the currently running process, it might be scheduled to run immediately, effectively transitioning directly from **Blocked** to **Running**.
- **Examples:**
  1. **High-Priority Processes:**
     - *Scenario:* A high-priority process was blocked waiting for I/O completion. Once the I/O operation completes, the process is unblocked. If the scheduler preempts the currently running lower-priority process, the unblocked high-priority process moves directly from **Blocked** to **Running**.
  2. **Real-Time Operating Systems:**
     - In real-time systems, tasks often have strict timing constraints. When a blocked task becomes unblocked, the scheduler may immediately dispatch it to run to meet deadline requirements.
  3. **Interrupt Handling:**
     - A blocked process waiting for an interrupt may be immediately scheduled upon the interrupt occurrence, especially if it's critical to handle the event without delay.
### **Visualization of All Possible Transitions**
For clarity, here's a depiction of all six possible transitions between the three states:
1. **Running → Ready**: Process is preempted by the scheduler (e.g., time slice expires).
2. **Running → Blocked**: Process blocks waiting for I/O or an event.
3. **Ready → Running**: Scheduler dispatches a process to run.
4. **Blocked → Ready**: An event or I/O completion unblocks the process.
5. **Ready → Blocked**: Process in the ready queue determines it cannot proceed and must wait for an event or resource.
6. **Blocked → Running**: Unblocked process is immediately scheduled to run.
