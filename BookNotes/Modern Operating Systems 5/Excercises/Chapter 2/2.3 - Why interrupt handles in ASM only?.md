### Question
Next question, On all current computers, at least part of the interrupt handlers are written in assembly language. Why?
### Answer
High-level languages typically abstract away direct CPU and hardware interactions to provide safety and portability, which restricts their use for writing interrupt handlers. Interrupt handlers often need to control CPU features directly, such as enabling or disabling hardware interrupts or accessing CPU registers. For example, an interrupt service routine (ISR) may need to rapidly disable interrupts to prevent nested interrupts during critical code sections or manipulate the stack for context switching. Additionally, ISRs need to execute as fast as possible to ensure real-time responsiveness, something assembly language is well-suited for due to its minimal instruction overhead.

### Code Example in Assembly for Enabling and Disabling Interrupts:
To illustrate why assembly is needed, hereâ€™s a basic example using inline assembly in Rust:

```rust
use core::arch::asm;

// Enable interrupts
unsafe fn enable_interrupts() {
    asm!("sti"); // Assembly instruction to set the interrupt flag, allowing interrupts
}

// Disable interrupts
unsafe fn disable_interrupts() {
    asm!("cli"); // Assembly instruction to clear the interrupt flag, disabling interrupts
}
```

### Explanation:
- **`sti` (Set Interrupt Flag)**: This instruction enables hardware interrupts by setting the interrupt flag in the CPU.
- **`cli` (Clear Interrupt Flag)**: This instruction disables hardware interrupts by clearing the interrupt flag, preventing new interrupts from being serviced.

### Why Assembly is Required:
- **Direct CPU Control**: High-level languages do not expose low-level CPU instructions like `sti` and `cli` natively.
- **Performance**: Assembly allows for minimal instruction sequences that execute with the highest performance, crucial for real-time interrupt handling.
- **Stack and Register Manipulation**: ISRs may need direct control over registers or the stack to save the state of the interrupted process and resume it accurately.

While high-level languages like Rust can use `unsafe` blocks and inline assembly for critical operations, pure assembly ensures maximum control and efficiency, which is vital for writing effective and reliable interrupt handlers.
