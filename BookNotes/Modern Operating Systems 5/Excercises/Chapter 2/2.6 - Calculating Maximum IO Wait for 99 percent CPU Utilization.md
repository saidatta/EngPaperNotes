### Question
A computer system has 2 GB of RAM, with 256 MB used by the operating system. Each process is 128 MB and has the same characteristics. If the goal is to achieve 99% CPU utilization, what is the maximum I/O wait time that can be tolerated by the processes?
### Answer
To determine the maximum I/O wait time that can be tolerated while maintaining 99% CPU utilization, we need to calculate how many processes can fit in the available RAM and then use this to find the I/O wait threshold.
### Step-by-Step Solution
1. **Total RAM available for processes**:Available RAM=2 GB−256 MB=1.75 GB=1750 MBAvailable RAM=2 GB−256 MB=1.75 GB=1750 MB
2. **Number of processes that can fit in the available RAM**:
    
    Number of processes=1750 MB128 MB per process=1750128≈13.67  ⟹  13 (since partial processes are not counted)Number of processes=128 MB per process1750 MB​=1281750​≈13.67⟹13 (since partial processes are not counted)
3. **CPU Utilization Formula**: Let pp be the probability that a process is waiting for I/O (i.e., the I/O wait time fraction). The probability that a process is _not_ waiting for I/O is 1−p1−p.
    
    For nn processes, the probability that _at least one_ process is using the CPU is given by:
    
    CPU Utilization=1−pnCPU Utilization=1−pn
4. **Setting up the equation for 99% CPU utilization**:
    
    1−p13=0.991−p13=0.99
    
    Solving for pp:
    
    p13=0.01p13=0.01p=0.0113p=130.01​

### Calculation (Using Rust-like Pseudocode)

rust

Copy code

`fn main() {     let cpu_utilization_target = 0.99;     let probability_all_waiting = 1.0 - cpu_utilization_target;     let num_processes = 13;          // Solve for the probability of I/O wait     let p = probability_all_waiting.powf(1.0 / num_processes as f64);     println!("Maximum I/O wait time fraction that can be tolerated: {:.4}", p); }`

### Result:

Using a calculator or a computational tool:

p=0.0113≈0.534p=130.01​≈0.534

### Conclusion:

The maximum I/O wait time that can be tolerated to maintain 99% CPU utilization is approximately **53.4%**. This means that each process can be waiting for I/O up to 53.4% of the time for the system to achieve the desired 99% CPU utilization.
