#### Overview
The Intel x86 architecture, up to the x86-64, utilized a virtual memory system combining segmentation and paging, similar to MULTICS. This note explores its implementation, reasons for phasing out segmentation in the x86-64, and current trends in memory management research.

#### Intel x86 Segmentation and Paging
1. **Segmentation in x86-32**:
   - The x86-32 had 16K independent segments, each potentially holding up to 1 billion 32-bit words.
   - This large segment size was crucial, accommodating most program needs despite fewer segments than MULTICS.

2. **Phasing Out in x86-64**:
   - Segmentation was deemed obsolete in x86-64, except for legacy mode.
   - Key reason: Lack of usage by major operating systems like UNIX and Windows, which prioritized cross-platform compatibility.
   - Intel's decision was influenced by the feature's underutilization, leading to its removal in 64-bit CPUs.

3. **Advantages of Original Design**:
   - The x86 design efficiently managed conflicting goals (supporting paging, segmentation, and compatibility with older architectures).

#### Recent Research Trends in Memory Management
1. **Distributed and Remote Memory**:
   - Focus on incorporating remote machine memory (Ruan et al., 2020).
   - Adaptation of applications to available memory, especially in cloud environments (Lion et al., 2021).

2. **Persistent Memory Integration**:
   - Research on seamless integration of persistent memory into existing systems (Neal et al., 2020).
   - Techniques for address conversion and crash-consistent distributed in-memory storage (Lee et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020).

3. **Security in Memory Management**:
   - Challenges with memory deduplication and its security implications (Bosman and Bos, 2016; Oliverio et al., 2017).
   - Heap layout manipulation for attack automation (Chen and Xing, 2019).

4. **Mitigating CPU Vulnerabilities**:
   - Operating system modifications in response to Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities.
   - Linux's kernel page table isolation (kpti) for strict page table isolation.

#### Summary
- **Legacy of Intel x86**: The architecture's memory model was innovative but eventually simplified due to limited usage in major operating systems.
- **Continued Evolution**: Memory management research is actively evolving, addressing new types of storage, security, and performance challenges in diverse computing environments, including datacenters and cloud platforms.
- **Segmentation Today**: While segmentation has seen reduced emphasis in modern systems, its principles continue to influence memory management strategies.
