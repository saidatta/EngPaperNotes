### Main Memory and Memory Management in Operating Systems
#### Overview
- **Context**: This note discusses the concept of main memory (RAM) management in operating systems, covering its evolution, models, and abstractions.
- **Key Point**: Despite the increase in memory size over the years, the demand for memory by programs tends to outpace the available memory, following a principle akin to Parkinson’s Law.
#### Historical Perspective
1. **IBM 7094 vs Modern Computers**: 
   - The IBM 7094, a prominent computer in the 1960s, had significantly less memory compared to contemporary home computers.
   - **Example**: A modern computer may have 100,000 times more memory than the IBM 7094.
#### Memory Management Challenges
1. **Ideal vs Realistic Memory**:
   - **Ideal Memory**: Programmers desire memory that is large, fast, nonvolatile, and inexpensive.
   - **Reality**: Such memory technology is currently unavailable.
2. **Memory Hierarchy**:
   - **Structure**: 
     - Fast, expensive, volatile cache memory (megabytes).
     - Medium-speed, medium-priced, volatile main memory (gigabytes).
     - Slow, cheap, nonvolatile magnetic or solid-state storage (terabytes).
     - Removable storage (e.g., USB sticks).
   - **Operating System Role**: Abstracting this hierarchy into a useful model and managing it.
3. **Memory Manager**:
   - **Responsibility**: Efficient memory management, tracking memory usage, allocating and deallocating memory to processes.
#### Memory Management Models
1. **No Memory Abstraction**:
   - **Historical Use**: Early mainframe, minicomputer, and personal computers.
   - **Functioning**: Direct interaction with physical memory.
   - **Limitation**: Inability to have multiple running programs simultaneously without interference.
   - **Programming Example**:
     ```assembly
     MOV REGISTER1,1000  ; 
     Moves the content of memory location 1000 to REGISTER1.
     ```
   - **Variations in OS Memory Placement**:
     - OS in RAM at the bottom of memory.
     - OS in ROM at the top of memory.
     - Device drivers in ROM at the top, the rest in RAM below.
   - **Safety**: Bugs in user programs can potentially disrupt the operating system.
2. **Single Process Execution**:
   - **Operation**: Loading and executing one program at a time from nonvolatile storage.
   - **User Interaction**: System waits for user commands between executions.

#### Figures
1. **Memory Organization Models** (Refer to Figure 3-1):
   - Three ways of organizing memory with an OS and one user process.
   - Variations include OS in RAM or ROM, and the presence of device drivers in ROM.
#### Potential for Parallelism
- **Threads in Single Memory Model**: Limited parallelism can be achieved through multi-threading within the same process.
- **Limitation**: This model is generally not suitable for running unrelated programs simultaneously.
#### Equations & Code
1. **Assembly Code Snippet**:
   - Demonstrates direct interaction with physical memory in early systems.
   - Example: `MOV REGISTER1,1000`
2. **Memory Management Algorithm Pseudocode** (Hypothetical):
   ```pseudo
   if memory_request > available_memory:
       allocate_memory_from_secondary_storage()
   else:
       allocate_memory_from_main_memory()
   ```
- One way to get some parallelism in a system with no memory abstraction is to program with multiple threads. Since all threads in a process are supposed to see the same memory image, the fact that they are forced to is not a problem. While this idea works, it is of limited use since what people often want is unrelated programs to be running at the same time, something the threads abstraction does not provide. Furthermore, any system that is so primitive as to provide no memory abstraction is unlikely to provide a threads abstraction.

### 3.1.1 - Running Multiple Programs Without Memory Abstraction
- **Context**: Explores the methods and challenges of running multiple programs without memory abstraction in operating systems, a concept crucial to modern OS design.
- **Key Point**: The need for efficient memory management is imperative, especially when dealing with limited or no memory abstraction.
#### Techniques for Running Multiple Programs
1. **Swapping**: 
   - **Concept**: Saving the entire contents of memory to nonvolatile storage, then loading and running the next program.
   - **Advantage**: Avoids conflicts as only one program is in memory at a time.
   - **Example**: Using disk storage to temporarily hold the state of a program.

2. **Special Hardware Use (IBM 360 Example)**:
   - **Mechanism**: Memory divided into blocks with assigned protection keys to prevent unauthorized access.
   - **Protection Keys**: Stored in CPU registers, used to trap attempts by a process to access unauthorized memory.
   - **Limitation**: Not a general solution and slows down loading.
   - 
   - **Programming Example**:
     ```assembly
     JMP 24  ; Jumps to the instruction at memory address 24.
     ```
#### Relocation Problem Illustrated
![[Screenshot 2023-11-14 at 3.01.43 PM.png]]
1. **Scenario Description**: Two 16-KB programs loaded consecutively in memory.
   - **Issue**: Programs referencing absolute physical memory addresses lead to crashes.
2. **Static Relocation as a Solution**:
   - **Process**: Modifying program addresses on the fly during loading.
   - **Challenge**: Differentiating between relocatable addresses and constants.
   - **Example**: Changing `JMP 28` to `JMP 16,412` when loaded at address 16,384.
#### Code Snippet for Static Relocation (Hypothetical)
```python
def static_relocation(program, start_address):
    for instruction in program:
        if is_address(instruction):
            instruction += start_address
    return program
```
#### Equations & Examples
1. **Equation for Relocation**: 
   - **Formula**: New Address = Original Address + Base Address.
   - **Example**: For a program starting at 16,384, `Original Address (28) + Base Address (16,384) = New Address (16,412)`.
#### Trends in Memory Management
1. **Embedded and Smart Card Systems**:
   - **Nature**: Often lack memory abstraction, using direct addressing of physical memory.
   - **Applicability**: Common in devices like radios, washing machines, where software is pre-determined.
2. **Modern Systems**:
   - **Evolution**: Advanced forms of memory management and isolation, moving beyond the IBM 360's model.
   - **Example**: Intel's addition of protection keys in CPUs since 2017, enhancing security.
#### Memory Management in Different Systems
1. **High-End Systems (e.g., Smartphones)**:
   - **Characteristics**: Elaborate operating systems with advanced memory management.
2. **Simpler Systems**:
   - **Approach**: Operating system as a library, offering basic system calls for I/O and other tasks.
   - **Example**: e-Cos operating system.
