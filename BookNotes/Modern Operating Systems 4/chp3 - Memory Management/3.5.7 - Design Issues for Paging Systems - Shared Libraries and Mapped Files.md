#### Overview of Shared Libraries
- **Context**: Large libraries used by many processes can inflate program sizes and memory usage.
- **Solution**: Shared libraries (or DLLs on Windows) allow multiple processes to use the same library without duplicating it in memory.
- **Implementation**: Programs are linked with small stub routines that bind to the actual library functions at runtime.

#### Traditional vs. Shared Library Linking
- **Traditional Linking**: Includes all necessary functions in the executable binary.
- **Shared Libraries**: Include stubs that dynamically link to library functions during execution, reducing executable size.

#### Advantages of Shared Libraries
1. **Space Efficiency**: Saves space on both nonvolatile storage and RAM.
2. **Dynamic Updates**: Bug fixes or updates in shared libraries automatically propagate to all dependent programs without recompilation.
3. **Example**: Microsoftâ€™s DLL updates via Windows Update.

#### Addressing Challenges
- **Position-Independent Code**: Shared libraries must avoid absolute addresses, using relative addressing to ensure compatibility across different process address spaces.
- **Example in Fig. 3-26**: Demonstrates the challenge when shared libraries are located at different addresses in different processes.

#### Mapped Files
- **Concept**: Memory-mapped files allow a file to be mapped onto a portion of a process's virtual address space.
- **Demand Paging**: Pages are paged in as needed, using the file on nonvolatile storage as backing storage.
- **Benefits**:
  - Provides an alternative I/O model by accessing files as arrays in memory.
  - Enables high-bandwidth inter-process communication through shared memory.
  - Underpins the implementation of shared libraries.

#### Code Example: Using Memory-Mapped Files
```python
# Pseudo-code example for memory-mapped file usage
def map_file_to_memory(file_path, virtual_address_space):
    # Map the file onto the virtual address space
    # No immediate loading of pages
    # Pages loaded on demand
    # Modified pages written back to file on process exit or unmapping
```

#### Key Takeaways
- **Shared Libraries and Mapped Files**: Crucial for efficient memory use and dynamic updating of widely used libraries.
- **Implementation Considerations**: Position-independent code is essential for shared libraries to function correctly across different processes.
- **Memory-Mapped Files**: Offer a versatile approach for file I/O and inter-process communication.
