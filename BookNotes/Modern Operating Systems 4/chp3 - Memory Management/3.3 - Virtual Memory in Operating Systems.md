#### Overview
- **Context**: This section explores the concept of virtual memory, a critical solution for managing large programs in modern operating systems.
- **Key Point**: Virtual memory allows running programs larger than the physical memory by dividing them into pages and mapping them onto physical memory.
#### Virtual Memory Concept
1. **Definition**: An abstraction where each program has its own address space, divided into pages.
2. **Functionality**:
   - Not all pages need to be in physical memory simultaneously.
   - Hardware maps pages to physical memory dynamically.
   - OS handles missing pages by fetching them as needed.
#### Historical Background
1. **Development**: Evolved to address the limitations of manual program overlays.
2. **Overlay Systems**:
   - Manual division of programs into smaller pieces.
   - Managed by an overlay manager for swapping in and out of memory.
#### Implementation
1. **Paging**:
   - **Description**: Uses fixed-size units (e.g., 4 KB) for memory mapping.
   - **Advantage**: Simplifies memory management.
2. **Segmentation**:
   - **Concept**: Uses variable-size segments.
   - **Current Status**: Less commonly used today.
#### Example: Virtual Memory Operation
- **Scenario**: A program tries to access a memory page that is not currently loaded in physical memory.
- **Process**:
  - The OS fetches the missing page from nonvolatile storage.
  - The instruction causing the fault is re-executed with the now-present page.
#### Code Snippet for Basic Page Mapping (Hypothetical)
```python
def map_page_to_memory(virtual_address, page_table):
    page_number = get_page_number(virtual_address)
    if page_table[page_number] is None:
        load_page_into_memory(page_number)
    return translate_to_physical_address(virtual_address, page_table)
```
#### Advantages of Virtual Memory
1. **Flexibility**: Allows programs to run that are larger than available physical memory.
2. **Efficiency**: Enables multiprogramming, allowing CPU use by other processes while waiting for page loading.
#### Virtual Memory vs Base-and-Limit Registers
- **Comparison**: Virtual memory generalizes the concept of base-and-limit registers, offering more granular control over the entire address space.
#### Equations & Examples
1. **Page Number Calculation**:
   - **Formula**: Page Number = Virtual Address / Page Size.
   - **Example**: For a 16-bit virtual address and 4 KB page size, Page Number = \( \frac{16,384}{4,096} \) = 4.
#### Further Exploration
- **Related Topics**:
  - Detailed study of paging and segmentation techniques.
  - Memory management in multiprogramming systems.
- **Next Steps**: Understanding the mechanisms of paging and its impact on system performance.

### 3.3.1 - Paging in Virtual Memory Systems
- **Context**: This section discusses paging, a key technique in virtual memory systems, essential for managing modern operating systems.
- **Key Point**: Paging allows a computer to handle and execute programs larger than its physical memory by breaking them down into fixed-size units.

#### Paging Mechanism
1. **Basic Concept**:
   - **Virtual Addresses**: Program-generated addresses.
   - **Physical Addresses**: Actual memory addresses.
   - **Memory Management Unit (MMU)**: Translates virtual addresses to physical addresses.
   - **Illustration**: See Fig. 3-8 for MMU functionality.
2. **Pages and Page Frames**:
   - **Pages**: Fixed-size units in virtual address space.
   - **Page Frames**: Corresponding units in physical memory.
   - **Example Sizes**: Range from 512 bytes to a gigabyte.
   - **Page Transfer**: Always in whole pages.

#### Example of Paging (Refer to Fig. 3-9)
1. **Address Mapping**:
   - Virtual address space of 64 KB, physical memory of 32 KB.
   - 16 virtual pages, 8 physical page frames.
   - Mapping virtual pages to physical frames as per MMU settings.
2. **Page Fault Handling**:
   - Occurs when a program references an unmapped address.
   - OS swaps out a little-used page and brings in the needed page.

#### MMU Operation and Page Table
1. **Address Translation**:
   - Virtual address split into page number and offset.
   - Page number used to index into the page table.
   - Physical address formed from page frame number and offset.
   - **Binary Example**: Virtual address 8196 â†’ Binary: 0010000000000100.
2. **Present/Absent Bit**: Indicates if a page is in physical memory.

#### Code Snippet for Simple Page Translation (Hypothetical)
```python
def translate_address(virtual_address, page_table):
    page_number, offset = split_address(virtual_address)
    if not page_table[page_number].present:
        handle_page_fault(page_number)
    physical_address = combine(page_table[page_number].frame, offset)
    return physical_address
```

#### Address Size Considerations
1. **32-bit Systems**: Manageable page table size with 4-KB pages.
2. **64-bit Systems**: Requires more complex methods due to the huge potential size of the page table.

#### Practical Implications
- **Flexibility**: Paging allows running large applications on systems with limited physical memory.
- **Efficiency**: Improves memory utilization and supports multiprogramming.

#### Further Exploration
- **Related Topics**:
  - Advanced paging techniques for large address spaces.
  - Memory management in 32-bit vs. 64-bit systems.
- **Next Steps**: Understanding the limitations and optimizations in paging for different system architectures.

### 3.3.2 - Page Tables in Virtual Memory Systems
- **Context**: This section delves into the structure and functionality of page tables in virtual memory systems, a crucial component in modern operating systems.
- **Key Point**: Page tables manage the mapping of virtual addresses to physical addresses, enabling efficient memory usage and program execution.
#### Page Table Mechanics
1. **Address Split**:
   - **Virtual Page Number**: High-order bits of the virtual address.
   - **Offset**: Low-order bits, specifying the byte within the page.
   - **Example**: With 16-bit addresses and 4-KB page size, upper 4 bits for page number, lower 12 for offset.
2. **Mapping Process**:
   - Virtual page number used as an index in the page table.
   - Page table maps virtual pages to physical frame numbers.
   - Physical address formed by attaching the page frame number to the offset.
   - **Illustration**: See Fig. 3-10 for internal MMU operation.

#### Structure of a Page Table Entry
1. **Common Fields**:
   - **Page Frame Number**: Primary output of page mapping.
   - **Present/Absent Bit**: Indicates if the page is currently in memory.
   - **Protection Bits**: Determine access permissions (read/write/execute).
   - **Supervisor Bit**: Distinguishes between OS and user program access.
   - **Modified (or Dirty) Bit**: Flags if the page has been written to.
   - **Referenced Bit**: Indicates if the page has been accessed recently.
   - **Caching Disabled Bit**: For pages mapping device registers.
   - **Example Layout**: Refer to Fig. 3-11 for a typical page table entry.

#### Page Table and Virtual Memory
- **Function**: An abstraction layer over physical memory, similar to how processes abstract the physical processor.
- **Implementation**: Breaks virtual address space into pages, each mapped to physical memory or temporarily unmapped.

#### Kernel and User Space Mapping
- **Usage**: Both user processes and operating systems utilize virtual addresses.
- **Context Switch Optimization**: Mapping OS page tables in user processes to avoid frequent context switches.

#### Code Snippet for Page Table Lookup (Hypothetical)
```python
def page_table_lookup(virtual_address, page_table):
    page_number = extract_page_number(virtual_address)
    if not page_table[page_number].present:
        raise PageFaultError("Page not in memory")
    frame_number = page_table[page_number].frame
    offset = extract_offset(virtual_address)
    return combine(frame_number, offset)
```

#### Addressing and Fault Handling
- **Error Trapping**: Addresses like 0 (often errors) are trapped by starting user programs at 4K.
- **Page Faults**: Triggered when accessing a virtual page not present in memory.

#### Further Exploration
- **Related Topics**:
  - Advanced page table structures in different architectures.
  - Page replacement algorithms and their role in virtual memory management.
- **Next Steps**: Examining shadow or nested page tables and their implications in virtualization.

### 3.3.3 - Speeding Up Paging in Virtual Memory Systems
- **Context**: This section addresses how to enhance the efficiency of paging in virtual memory systems, focusing on reducing latency and managing large virtual address spaces.
- **Key Points**: Fast virtual-to-physical address mapping and efficient page table management are crucial for high-performance paging systems.
#### Challenges in Paging
1. **Fast Address Mapping**: Essential as mapping occurs for every memory reference.
2. **Page Table Size**: Needs to be manageable, especially with large virtual address spaces in modern systems.
#### Solutions to Speed Up Paging
1. **Translation Lookaside Buffers (TLBs)**:
   - **Function**: Caches recent page mappings, avoiding frequent page table lookups.
   - **Operation**: Checks if a virtual address's page is in the TLB before resorting to the page table.
   - **Efficiency**: Greatly reduces the number of memory accesses for page mapping.
   - **Illustration**: Refer to Fig. 3-12 for a TLB example.
2. **Software TLB Management**:
   - Used in some RISC architectures like SPARC, MIPS.
   - TLB entries are explicitly loaded by the OS.
   - TLB faults are handled by the OS, not by the hardware.
#### TLB Functionality
- **TLB Misses**:
  - **Soft Miss**: Occurs when the page is in memory but not in the TLB.
  - **Hard Miss**: The page is not in memory, requiring disk access.
- **Handling TLB Misses**:
  - **Soft Miss**: Relatively quick to handle, usually taking 10-20 instructions.
  - **Hard Miss**: Much slower, involving disk or SSD access.
#### Page Table Walks
- **Purpose**: To find the mapping in the page table hierarchy.
- **Types of Page Faults**:
  - **Minor Page Fault**: Page in memory but not in the process's page table.
  - **Major Page Fault**: Requires fetching the page from nonvolatile storage.
  - **Invalid Address**: Leads to a program error, often resulting in a segmentation fault.
#### Code Snippet for TLB Lookup (Hypothetical)
```python
def tlb_lookup(virtual_address, tlb):
    page_number = extract_page_number(virtual_address)
    for entry in tlb:
        if entry.valid and entry.virtual_page == page_number:
            return combine(entry.frame, extract_offset(virtual_address))
    raise TLBMissError("Page not in TLB")
```
#### Trade-offs in TLB Design
- **Size vs. Efficiency**: Larger TLBs reduce misses but are more expensive and take up more chip area.
- **Hardware vs. Software TLB Management**: Hardware TLB management is more common, but software management offers a simpler MMU and flexibility.
#### Impact on Performance
- **Improvement**: TLBs significantly speed up memory access in virtual memory systems.
- **Balance**: Optimizing TLB size and management is key to efficient paging.
#### Further Exploration
- **Related Topics**:
  - Advanced TLB architectures and their impact on system performance.
  - Memory management techniques in different CPU architectures.
- **Next Steps**: Delving into optimizations for large virtual address spaces in 64-bit systems.

### 3.3.4 - Page Tables for Large Memories in Virtual Memory Systems
- **Context**: Addressing the challenge of managing large virtual address spaces in virtual memory systems.
- **Key Points**: Multilevel page tables and inverted page tables are two primary methods to handle large memory spaces efficiently.
#### Multilevel Page Tables
1. **Concept**:
   - Uses multiple levels of page tables to manage large address spaces.
   - Reduces memory requirement by only keeping necessary page tables in memory.
2. **Example**: 
   - **32-bit Address**: Split into a PT1 field (10-bit), a PT2 field (10-bit), and an Offset field (12-bit).
   - **Page Table Structure**: See Fig. 3-13 for a two-level page table system.
3. **Working**:
   - The virtual page number is divided into parts, each indexing into a different level of page tables.
   - Each level narrows down the physical address location.
4. **Address Translation Example**: 
   - For virtual address 0x00403004, PT1 = 1, PT2 = 3, Offset = 4.
   - Translates to a specific physical memory location.

#### Evolution of Multilevel Page Tables
1. **Examples**:
   - **Intel 80386**: Used a two-level page table system.
   - **Pentium Pro**: Added a third level (page directory pointer table).
   - **Modern 64-bit Systems**: Can address a vast memory space, necessitating additional levels.
2. **Impact**:
   - Additional levels provide more flexibility and addressability.
   - However, they make page table walks more expensive.

#### Inverted Page Tables
1. **Description**:
   - One entry per page frame in physical memory.
   - Tracks which (process, virtual page) is located in each page frame.
2. **Advantages**:
   - Saves space when the virtual address space is much larger than physical memory.
3. **Challenge**:
   - Makes virtual-to-physical translation harder, requiring search through the entire table on each memory reference.
4. **TLB Usage**:
   - Relies on the TLB to hold frequently used pages for fast access.
   - On a TLB miss, the inverted page table must be searched.
5. **Hash Table Solution**: 
   - Facilitates faster search through the inverted page table.
   - **Illustration**: Refer to Fig. 3-14 for comparison with traditional page tables.

#### Code Snippet for Multilevel Page Table Lookup (Hypothetical)
```python
def multilevel_page_table_lookup(virtual_address, top_level_table):
    pt1, pt2, offset = split_address(virtual_address)
    second_level_table = top_level_table[pt1]
    frame_number = second_level_table[pt2]
    return combine(frame_number, offset)
```

#### Implications for Performance and Memory Usage
- **Performance**: Multilevel page tables and inverted page tables offer a trade-off between memory usage and speed of address translation.
- **Memory Efficiency**: Both methods aim to reduce the memory overhead associated with large page tables.

#### Further Exploration
- **Related Topics**:
  - Optimization techniques for page table management.
  - Handling virtual memory in 64-bit architectures with extensive address spaces.
- **Next Steps**: Investigating the impact of these methods on system performance and memory management strategies.
