#### Overview
- **Context**: Exploring advanced design considerations in paging systems, focusing on load control and cleaning policies, crucial for efficient memory management in operating systems.
- **Key Point**: Addressing system thrashing and memory contention through strategic process management and memory cleaning.
#### Load Control in Paging Systems
1. **Thrashing Issue**: When combined working sets of all processes exceed memory capacity, thrashing occurs, leading to high page fault rates.
2. **OOM (Out of Memory) Killer**:
   - System process that terminates processes to free up memory.
   - Assigns 'badness' scores to processes based on memory usage.
3. **Swapping Strategy**:
   - Temporarily relocates processes to nonvolatile storage to free memory.
   - Used to reduce memory demand rather than reclaim pages.
4. **Degree of Multiprogramming**:
   - Balances number of processes in memory.
   - Considers process characteristics (CPU-bound, I/O-bound) in decisions.
5. **Memory Reduction Techniques**:
   - Compaction, compression, and deduplication (same page merging).
   - Sharing of identical pages between processes (copy-on-write mechanism).
#### Cleaning Policy in Paging Systems
1. **Paging Daemon**:
   - Background process that periodically checks memory state.
   - Ensures a sufficient supply of free (and preferably clean) page frames.
2. **Two-Handed Clock Algorithm**:
   - Front hand (paging daemon) cleans dirty pages and advances.
   - Back hand used for standard page replacement, now likely to encounter more clean pages.
#### Code Snippet: Implementing OOM Killer (Simplified)
```python
def oom_killer(processes):
    processes.sort(key=lambda p: p.badness_score(), reverse=True)
    for process in processes:
        if sufficient_memory_freed():
            break
        terminate_process(process)
```

#### Performance and Efficiency Considerations
- **Balancing Memory Usage**: Essential for preventing thrashing and optimizing system performance.
- **Cleaning Policy**: Enhances page replacement efficiency by maintaining a pool of clean pages.

#### Further Exploration
- **Related Topics**:
  - Investigating the impact of various load control strategies on different types of workloads.
  - Examining the efficiency of different cleaning algorithms in real-world scenarios.
- **Next Steps**: Testing and comparing the performance of load control and cleaning policies under various system loads and configurations.
