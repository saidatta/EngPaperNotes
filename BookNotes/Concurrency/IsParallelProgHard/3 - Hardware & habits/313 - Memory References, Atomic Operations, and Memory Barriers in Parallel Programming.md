## Overview
- In recent times, microprocessors can execute hundreds or even thousands of instructions in the time required to access memory due to the high speed of CPU operation versus memory latency.
- Large caches on modern microprocessors can help combat memory-access latencies, but these require highly predictable data-access patterns.
- Common operations such as traversing a linked list have extremely unpredictable memory-access patterns, posing obstacles to modern CPUs.
- Atomic operations and memory barriers also present challenges, particularly in multi-threaded environments.

## Memory References
- Memory latency has not decreased at the same rate as CPU performance has increased under Moore's Law.
- Modern CPU designers construct memories (now called “level-0 caches”) to help mitigate memory latency issues.
- Large caches can combat memory-access latencies, but they require predictable data-access patterns to hide these latencies successfully.
- Common operations like linked list traversals, with unpredictable memory-access patterns, pose challenges for modern CPUs.

## Atomic Operations
- Atomic operations, which need to execute entirely or not at all without any interruption, conflict with the piece-by-piece nature of CPU pipelines.
- Modern CPUs use various techniques to make these operations appear atomic despite their execution in stages.
- One common method is to identify all the cachelines containing the data to be atomically operated on, ensure that these cachelines are owned by the executing CPU, and then carry out the atomic operation.
- This process can sometimes require delaying or flushing the pipeline.

## Memory Barriers
- Most CPUs provide memory barriers to maintain order between updates of multiple data elements, often needed by parallel algorithms.
- Memory barriers prevent harmful reordering of operations, particularly critical in multi-threading where operations could otherwise execute out of intended order due to optimization efforts by the CPU.
- Locking primitives contain either explicit or implicit memory barriers to prevent such reordering.
- However, memory barriers often reduce performance as they prevent optimizations that the CPU would otherwise make.

Example of a critical section with a lock:

```c
spin_lock(&mylock);
a = a + 1;
spin_unlock(&mylock);
```

## Future Challenges
- CPU designers are working hard to reduce the overhead associated with memory barriers and atomic operations.
- The next sections will discuss further challenges such as thermal throttling.

## Quick Quiz Answer
- Machines that allow atomic operations on multiple data elements would be those equipped with hardware transactional memory or special atomic instructions that operate on larger chunks of data. However, such machines are not common as of the knowledge cutoff in September 2021.
