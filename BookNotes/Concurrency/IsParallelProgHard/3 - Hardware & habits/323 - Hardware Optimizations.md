## Overview
Hardware optimizations aim to significantly enhance the performance of parallel computing. This section outlines six principal hardware optimizations:
1. Large cachelines
2. Cache prefetching
3. Store buffers
4. Speculative execution
5. Large caches
6. Read-mostly replication

## Large Cachelines

- Large cachelines can boost performance, especially when memory is accessed sequentially.
- A 64-byte cacheline with software accessing 64-bit variables, while the first access may be slow (due to unavoidable speed-of-light delays), the remaining seven can be quite fast.
- **Drawback**: The risk of false sharing, where different variables in the same cacheline are being updated by different CPUs, leading to a high cache-miss rate.
- A common step to avoid false sharing in tuning parallel software is using alignment directives available in many compilers.

## Cache Prefetching

- This optimization enables the hardware to respond to consecutive accesses by prefetching subsequent cachelines, thereby sidestepping speed-of-light delays.
- The hardware uses simple heuristics to determine when to prefetch, but these can be deceived by complex data access patterns in many applications.
- Some CPU families provide special prefetch instructions to mitigate this, but their effectiveness in general remains debatable.

## Store Buffers

- Store buffers let a string of store instructions execute quickly, even when the stores are to non-consecutive addresses, and when none of the needed cachelines are present in the CPU’s cache.
- **Drawback**: The risk of memory misordering (detailed in Chapter 15).

## Speculative Execution

- This optimization can permit the hardware to efficiently utilize store buffers without leading to memory misordering.
- **Drawbacks**: Potential energy inefficiency and decreased performance if the speculative execution misfires and needs to be rolled back and retried. Spectre and Meltdown vulnerabilities have exposed that hardware speculation can enable side-channel attacks that bypass memory-protection hardware.

## Large Caches

- Large caches allow individual CPUs to work on larger datasets without incurring costly cache misses.
- **Drawback**: Large caches can downgrade energy efficiency and cache-miss latency.
- Despite these issues, the increasing cache sizes on production microprocessors underscore the strength of this optimization.

## Read-Mostly Replication

- Data that is often read but seldom updated is replicated in all CPUs’ caches. This optimization allows for exceedingly efficient access to read-mostly data.

## Key Point

Hardware and software engineers collectively strive to overcome physical laws to speed up computing processes. There are further potential optimizations that hardware engineers might be able to implement, contingent on the practical applicability of recent research.

The contributions of software to this objective are discussed in the succeeding chapters of the book.
