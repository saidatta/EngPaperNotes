## Introduction

In this chapter, we will explore how to implement operating system primitives in Rust, such as mutexes, condition variables, and reader-writer locks. We will dive into the specifics of interfacing with the operating system's kernel to efficiently block and wake up threads, moving beyond busy-wait loops to more efficient solutions involving syscalls.
### Overview
Efficiently blocking and waking up threads requires the help of the operating system's kernel. The kernel's scheduler manages which threads run on which processor cores and for how long. To interact with the kernel, we use syscalls, which are specialized instructions for communicating with the kernel.
### Syscalls and Libraries
The method of communicating with the kernel varies by operating system. Typically, higher-level libraries handle these details for us. For example, Rust's standard library provides functions like `File::open()` that internally make syscalls to the operating system.
- **POSIX Systems**: On Unix-like systems (e.g., Linux, macOS), the libc library provides standard interfaces to the kernel. Rust uses the `libc` crate to interface with libc.
- **Windows**: Windows uses different libraries (e.g., `kernel32.dll`) to provide functions like `CreateFileW`.
### Syscall Wrappers
We can wrap syscalls in Rust functions to interact with the kernel directly. This is useful for implementing low-level synchronization primitives like futexes on Linux.
## POSIX Threads (pthreads)
### Overview
POSIX Threads (pthreads) provide standard concurrency primitives on Unix systems. These include mutexes, reader-writer locks, and condition variables.
### Mutexes (`pthread_mutex_t`)
- **Initialization**: `pthread_mutex_init()` initializes a mutex, and `pthread_mutex_destroy()` destroys it.
- **Locking**: `pthread_mutex_lock()`, `pthread_mutex_trylock()`, and `pthread_mutex_timedlock()` are used for locking with optional time limits.
- **Attributes**: Mutex attributes (e.g., recursive locking behavior) can be set using `pthread_mutexattr_t`.
### Reader-Writer Locks (`pthread_rwlock_t`)
- **Initialization**: `pthread_rwlock_init()` and `pthread_rwlock_destroy()` initialize and destroy a reader-writer lock.
- **Locking**: `pthread_rwlock_rdlock()`, `pthread_rwlock_tryrdlock()`, `pthread_rwlock_wrlock()`, and `pthread_rwlock_trywrlock()` are used for locking.
- **Unlocking**: `pthread_rwlock_unlock()` unlocks a reader or writer lock.
### Condition Variables (`pthread_cond_t`)
- **Initialization**: `pthread_cond_init()` and `pthread_cond_destroy()` initialize and destroy a condition variable.
- **Waiting**: `pthread_cond_wait()` and `pthread_cond_timedwait()` are used to wait for a condition.
- **Signaling**: `pthread_cond_signal()` wakes one waiting thread, and `pthread_cond_broadcast()` wakes all waiting threads.
### Wrapping in Rust
To wrap pthread primitives in Rust, we need to address issues like mutability and memory stability.

```rust
use std::cell::UnsafeCell;
use std::ptr;
use libc;

pub struct Mutex {
    m: UnsafeCell<libc::pthread_mutex_t>,
}

impl Mutex {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        let mut m = UnsafeCell::new(unsafe { std::mem::zeroed() });
        unsafe {
            libc::pthread_mutex_init(m.get(), ptr::null());
        }
        Self { m }
    }

    pub fn lock(&self) {
        unsafe {
            libc::pthread_mutex_lock(self.m.get());
        }
    }

    pub fn unlock(&self) {
        unsafe {
            libc::pthread_mutex_unlock(self.m.get());
        }
    }
}

impl Drop for Mutex {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        unsafe {
            libc::pthread_mutex_destroy(self.m.get());
        }
    }
}
```

### Boxed Mutex for Memory Stability
To ensure memory stability, we can wrap the mutex in a `Box`.
```rust
pub struct BoxedMutex {
    m: Box<UnsafeCell<libc::pthread_mutex_t>>,
}

impl BoxedMutex {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        let mut m = Box::new(UnsafeCell::new(unsafe { std::mem::zeroed() }));
        unsafe {
            libc::pthread_mutex_init(m.get(), ptr::null());
        }
        Self { m }
    }

    // Lock and unlock methods here...

    impl Drop for BoxedMutex {
        fn drop(&mut self) {
            unsafe {
                libc::pthread_mutex_destroy(self.m.get());
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Linux Futex
### Overview
The futex syscall on Linux provides efficient blocking and waking up of threads using a 32-bit atomic integer. The main operations are `FUTEX_WAIT` and `FUTEX_WAKE`.
### Futex Operations
#### Wrapping Futex Syscalls
```rust
use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicU32, Ordering};
use libc;

pub fn futex_wait(a: &AtomicU32, expected: u32) {
    unsafe {
        libc::syscall(
            libc::SYS_futex,
            a as *const AtomicU32,
            libc::FUTEX_WAIT,
            expected,
            ptr::null::<libc::timespec>(),
        );
    }
}

pub fn futex_wake_one(a: &AtomicU32) {
    unsafe {
        libc::syscall(
            libc::SYS_futex,
            a as *const AtomicU32,
            libc::FUTEX_WAKE,
            1,
        );
    }
}

pub fn futex_wake_all(a: &AtomicU32) {
    unsafe {
        libc::syscall(
            libc::SYS_futex,
            a as *const AtomicU32,
            libc::FUTEX_WAKE,
            std::i32::MAX,
        );
    }
}
```

#### Usage Example

```rust
use std::sync::atomic::AtomicU32;
use std::thread;
use std::time::Duration;

fn main() {
    let a = AtomicU32::new(0);

    thread::scope(|s| {
        s.spawn(|| {
            thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(3));
            a.store(1, Ordering::Relaxed);
            futex_wake_one(&a);
        });

        println!("Waiting...");
        while a.load(Ordering::Relaxed) == 0 {
            futex_wait(&a, 0);
        }
        println!("Done!");
    });
}
```

### Avoiding Busy-Looping Writers
To avoid busy-looping writers, we can use a separate atomic variable for writers to wait on.
```rust
pub struct RwLock<T> {
    state: AtomicU32,
    writer_wake_counter: AtomicU32,
    value: UnsafeCell<T>,
}

impl<T> RwLock<T> {
    pub const fn new(value: T) -> Self {
        Self {
            state: AtomicU32::new(0),
            writer_wake_counter: AtomicU32::new(0),
            value: UnsafeCell::new(value),
        }
    }

    pub fn write(&self) -> WriteGuard<T> {
        while self.state.compare_exchange(0, u32::MAX, Ordering::Acquire, Ordering::Relaxed).is_err() {
            let w = self.writer_wake_counter.load(Ordering::Acquire);
            if self.state.load(Ordering::Relaxed) != 0 {
                futex_wait(&self.writer_wake_counter, w);
            }
        }
        WriteGuard { rwlock: self }
    }
}

impl<T> Drop for WriteGuard<'_, T> {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        self.rwlock.state.store(0, Ordering::Release);
        self.rwlock.writer_wake_counter.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Release);
        futex_wake_one(&self.rwlock.writer_wake_counter);
        futex_wake_all(&self.rwlock.state);
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

Implementing operating system primitives in Rust requires a deep understanding of both Rust's ownership and borrowing rules and the specific syscalls provided by the operating system. By carefully wrapping these syscalls and managing state efficiently, we can create high-performance synchronization primitives that leverage the full power of the operating system's kernel.
