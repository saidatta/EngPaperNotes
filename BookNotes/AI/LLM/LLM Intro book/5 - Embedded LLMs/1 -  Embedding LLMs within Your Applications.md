## Introduction

**LLMs** have revolutionized software development by enabling applications that offer smooth and conversational interactions between users and machines. They enhance existing applications, such as chatbots and recommendation systems, with advanced reasoning capabilities.

To stay competitive, enterprises are increasingly integrating LLMs into their applications. Frameworks like **LangChain**, **Semantic Kernel**, **Haystack**, and **LlamaIndex** facilitate this integration. This guide focuses on using **LangChain** to build LLM-powered applications.

## LangChain Overview

**LangChain** is a lightweight framework designed to simplify the integration and orchestration of LLMs and their components within applications. While it is primarily Python-based, it has extended support for JavaScript and TypeScript.

### Key Features

- **Core Backbone**: Contains abstractions and runtime logic.
- **Third-Party Integrations**: Supports over 50 integrations with platforms like OpenAI, Azure, and Hugging Face.
- **Pre-built Architectures**: Offers templates and architectures for rapid development.
- **Serving Layer**: Enables consumption of chains as APIs.
- **Observability Layer**: Facilitates monitoring and debugging of applications.
- **LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)**: Enhances text processing efficiency and flexibility.

### Installation

LangChain is organized into several packages:

1. **langchain-core**: Core abstractions and runtime.
2. **langchain-experimental**: Experimental code for research purposes.
3. **langchain-community**: Third-party integrations.

Additional packages:

## Getting Started with LangChain

LangChain's architecture comprises several key components:

1. **Models and Prompts**
2. **Data Connections**
3. **Memory**
4. **Chains**
5. **Agents**

### Models and Prompts

LangChain provides seamless integration with various LLMs and supports prompt engineering.

#### Prompt Templates

A **Prompt Template** defines how to generate a prompt for an LLM. It can include variables, placeholders, prefixes, suffixes, and other customizable elements.

**Example**:

```python
from langchain import PromptTemplate

template = """Sentence: {sentence}
Translation in {language}:"""
prompt = PromptTemplate(template=template, input_variables=["sentence", "language"])

print(prompt.format(sentence="the cat is on the table", language="Spanish"))
```

**Output**:

```
Sentence: the cat is on the table
Translation in Spanish:
```

**Explanation**:

- `{sentence}` and `{language}` are placeholders.
- The `PromptTemplate` allows for dynamic prompt generation.

#### Example Selectors

An **Example Selector** allows dynamic selection of examples to include in a prompt, aiding in tasks like few-shot learning.

**Concept**:

- Examples are provided to the model to guide its responses.
- The selector chooses relevant examples based on the input.

**Implementation**:

```python
from langchain.prompts import FewShotPromptTemplate

# Define examples
examples = [
    {"word": "happy", "antonym": "sad"},
    {"word": "big", "antonym": "small"},
    # More examples...
]

# Create a prompt template with examples
example_prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["word", "antonym"],
    template="Word: {word}\nAntonym: {antonym}\n"
)

few_shot_prompt = FewShotPromptTemplate(
    examples=examples,
    example_prompt=example_prompt,
    prefix="Find the antonym of the following words:",
    suffix="Word: {input}\nAntonym:",
    input_variables=["input"]
)

# Format the prompt
print(few_shot_prompt.format(input="cold"))
```

**Output**:

```
Find the antonym of the following words:

Word: happy
Antonym: sad

Word: big
Antonym: small

Word: cold
Antonym:
```

**Explanation**:

- The `FewShotPromptTemplate` includes examples in the prompt.
- Helps the model understand the task better.

### Data Connections

**Data Connections** enable LangChain to interact with various data sources, such as databases, APIs, and file systems.

- **Integrations**: Supports connectors to data stores like SQL databases, Elasticsearch, and more.
- **Use Cases**: Retrieve information, perform data augmentation, and feed context to LLMs.

### Memory

**Memory** in LangChain allows the LLM to maintain state between interactions.

- **Conversation Memory**: Stores previous messages to maintain context in a chat application.
- **Types of Memory**:
  - **Buffer Memory**: Stores all interactions.
  - **Summary Memory**: Summarizes past interactions to save space.
  - **Entity Memory**: Keeps track of specific entities mentioned.

**Implementation Example**:

```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

llm = OpenAI(openai_api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
memory = ConversationBufferMemory()

conversation = ConversationChain(
    llm=llm,
    memory=memory,
    verbose=True
)

# Start conversation
conversation.predict(input="Hello!")
conversation.predict(input="What's the weather today?")
```

**Explanation**:

- `ConversationBufferMemory` keeps track of the conversation history.
- The model uses this history to generate context-aware responses.

### Chains

**Chains** are sequences of operations or prompts that process inputs to produce outputs.

- **Simple Chain**: A single prompt and response.
- **Sequential Chain**: Multiple steps processed in order.
- **Conditional Chain**: Flow depends on certain conditions.

**Example: Simple Chain**

```python
from langchain import LLMChain

llm = OpenAI(openai_api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["product"],
    template="Write a catchy tagline for a {product}."
)

chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)

# Run the chain
print(chain.run("smartphone"))
```

**Output**:

```
"Stay Connected, Stay Ahead with Our Next-Gen Smartphone!"
```

### Agents

**Agents** use LLMs to decide which actions to take, tools to use, and in what order.

- **Tools**: Functions that agents can invoke (e.g., calculators, search APIs).
- **Decision Making**: Agents interpret user input and decide on actions.

**Example: Agent with Tools**

```python
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, Tool
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

# Define tools
def calculator(query):
    return eval(query)

tools = [
    Tool(
        name="Calculator",
        func=calculator,
        description="Useful for mathematical calculations."
    )
]

llm = OpenAI(openai_api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# Initialize the agent
agent = initialize_agent(
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm,
    agent="zero-shot-react-description",
    verbose=True
)

# Run the agent
response = agent.run("What is 25 multiplied by 4?")
print(response)
```

**Output**:

```
100
```

**Explanation**:

- The agent decides to use the calculator tool to compute the answer.

## Working with LLMs via the Hugging Face Hub

### Setting Up Hugging Face Integration

To work with models from the **Hugging Face Hub**, you need:

- A Hugging Face account: [Sign up here](https://huggingface.co/join)
- An access token: Obtain from [Settings](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)

**Installation**:

```bash
pip install huggingface_hub
```

### Using Open-Source LLMs

LangChain allows you to integrate open-source LLMs from Hugging Face.

**Example: Using a Hugging Face Model**

```python
from langchain import HuggingFaceHub

# Set your Hugging Face API token
import os
os.environ["HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN"] = "YOUR_API_TOKEN"

# Initialize the model
repo_id = "google/flan-t5-small"  # Example model
llm = HuggingFaceHub(repo_id=repo_id, model_kwargs={"temperature": 0.5})

# Use the model
response = llm("Translate 'Hello, how are you?' to French.")
print(response)
```

**Output**:

```
"Bonjour, comment allez-vous?"
```

**Explanation**:

- `HuggingFaceHub` connects to the specified model repository.
- `model_kwargs` allows you to set model-specific parameters.

## Technical Requirements

To follow along with the examples, ensure you have:

1. **Accounts and Access Tokens**:
   - **Hugging Face**: Account and API token.
   - **OpenAI**: Account and API key.

2. **Python Environment**:
   - **Python 3.7.1** or later.
   - **Python Packages**:
     - `langchain`
     - `python-dotenv`
     - `huggingface_hub`
     - `google-search-results`
     - `faiss`
     - `tiktoken`

   **Installation via pip**:

   ```bash
   pip install langchain python-dotenv huggingface_hub google-search-results faiss-cpu tiktoken
   ```

   **Note**: For `faiss`, use `faiss-cpu` unless you have a GPU setup.
