## Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and BERT have demonstrated extraordinary capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text. Beyond their standalone functionalities, LLMs are transforming software development by serving as platforms for building powerful, AI-driven applications.

## How LLMs are Changing Software Development

LLMs are not just tools; they are platforms that developers can leverage to build sophisticated applications without starting from scratch.

### Technical Aspect: Integrating LLMs

- **API Integration**: Developers can make REST API calls to hosted LLMs.
- **Customization**: LLMs can be fine-tuned for specific needs.
- **Architectural Components**: Incorporating LLMs involves setting up components that allow seamless communication via API calls and managing them with AI orchestrators.

#### Example: Basic API Call to OpenAI's GPT-3

```python
import openai

openai.api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'

response = openai.Completion.create(
  engine="text-davinci-003",
  prompt="Explain the concept of recursion in computer science.",
  max_tokens=150
)

print(response.choices[0].text.strip())
```

### Conceptual Aspect: The Copilot System

- **New Capabilities**: LLMs bring reasoning, understanding, and generative abilities to applications.
- **Copilot as a Software Category**: Viewing LLMs as copilots highlights their role in enhancing application functionalities.

## The Copilot System

### Definition and Features

A **copilot system** is an AI assistant that collaborates with users to accomplish complex tasks. It is powered by LLMs and integrates other technologies like apps, data sources, and user interfaces.

#### Key Features

1. **Powered by LLMs**: The reasoning engine that makes the copilot intelligent.
2. **Conversational User Interface (UI)**: Users interact using natural language.
3. **Scoped Functionality**: Grounded to domain-specific data.
4. **Extensible Capabilities**: Enhanced through skills and plug-ins.

### Grounding and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

**Grounding** ensures the copilot operates within a specific domain by providing it with relevant, use-case-specific information not present in its training data.

#### Definition

- **Grounding**: Using domain-specific data to limit the scope of the LLM's responses.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Enhancing LLM output by incorporating external knowledge bases before generating responses.

#### Example: Grounding in Action

Suppose we have a database of company policies. We want our copilot to answer employee questions based on these policies only.

```plaintext
User: "What is the company's leave policy?"
Copilot: [Grounds the response using the company policy documents]
```

### Extending Capabilities with Skills and Plug-ins

#### Skills

- **Definition**: Code or calls to other models that extend the copilot's capabilities.
- **Purpose**: Overcome limitations like knowledge cutoff dates or lack of execution ability.

#### Plug-ins

- **Definition**: Connectors that allow the LLM to interact with external systems.
- **Types**:
  - **Input Plug-ins**: Extend non-parametric knowledge (e.g., web search).
  - **Output Plug-ins**: Enable the copilot to perform actions (e.g., post on social media).

#### Example: LinkedIn Plug-in

- **Function**: Allows the copilot to post generated content directly to LinkedIn.
- **Workflow**:
  1. User asks the copilot to draft a post.
  2. Copilot generates the content.
  3. Copilot uses the LinkedIn plug-in to publish the post.

```python
def post_to_linkedin(content):
    access_token = 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'
    api_url = 'https://api.linkedin.com/v2/shares'

    headers = {
        'Authorization': f'Bearer {access_token}',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'X-Restli-Protocol-Version': '2.0.0'
    }

    data = {
        "content": {
            "contentEntities": [],
            "title": content
        },
        "distribution": {
            "linkedInDistributionTarget": {}
        },
        "owner": "urn:li:person:YOUR_PERSON_ID",
        "subject": "Automated Post",
        "text": {
            "text": content
        }
    }

    response = requests.post(api_url, headers=headers, json=data)
    return response.status_code
```

### Prompt Engineering

**Prompt Engineering** is the craft of designing effective prompts to guide the LLM's output.

#### Importance

- Influences the quality and relevance of the generated content.
- Helps in controlling the behavior of the LLM.

#### Metaprompts

- **Definition**: Backend prompts or system messages that instruct the LLM on how to behave.
- **Example**:

  ```plaintext
  You are an AI assistant specialized in company policy. Answer queries based only on the provided documents.
  ```

#### Example: Prompt Engineering for Style

```plaintext
System Message: "Act as a teacher who explains complex concepts to 5-year-old children."

User: "What is quantum physics?"

LLM Response: "Quantum physics is like a set of rules that explain how tiny things, like atoms and particles, behave. It's different from the rules we see in everyday life, and it helps us understand how the smallest parts of the universe work."
```

## Introducing AI Orchestrators to Embed LLMs into Applications

AI orchestrators are libraries that facilitate the embedding and management of LLMs within applications.

### Main Components of AI Orchestrators

#### Models

- **Proprietary LLMs**:
  - **Examples**: GPT-3, GPT-4 (OpenAI), Bard (Google).
  - **Characteristics**: Closed-source, cannot be retrained from scratch but can be fine-tuned.

- **Open-Source LLMs**:
  - **Examples**: Falcon LLM, LLaMA (Meta).
  - **Characteristics**: Source code available, can be retrained and customized.

#### Memory

- **Purpose**: Stores conversation history and context.
- **Implementation**: Uses Vector Databases (VectorDB) to store embeddings of past interactions.

##### VectorDB

- **Definition**: A database optimized for storing and querying vector embeddings.
- **Use Cases**: Semantic search, similarity matching.
- **Examples**:
  - **Chroma**
  - **Elasticsearch**
  - **Milvus**
  - **Pinecone**
  - **Qdrant**
  - **Weaviate**
  - **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)**

##### Example: Storing Embeddings in FAISS

```python
import faiss
import numpy as np

# Assume we have embeddings for previous interactions
embeddings = np.array([[0.1, 0.3, 0.5], [0.2, 0.4, 0.6]]).astype('float32')

# Create an index
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(3)  # dimension is 3

# Add embeddings to the index
index.add(embeddings)

# Query the index
query_vector = np.array([[0.15, 0.35, 0.55]]).astype('float32')
D, I = index.search(query_vector, k=1)
print(f"Closest match index: {I[0][0]}, Distance: {D[0][0]}")
```

#### Plug-ins

- **Function**: Extend the LLM's abilities to interact with external systems.
- **Examples**:
  - **Wikipedia Plug-in**: Allows the LLM to fetch up-to-date information.
  - **Database Plug-in**: Enables querying databases using natural language.

#### Prompts

##### Frontend Prompts

- **Definition**: User inputs in natural language.
- **Example**:

  ```plaintext
  "Find the total sales for last quarter."
  ```

##### Backend Prompts (Metaprompts)

- **Definition**: Instructions that guide the LLM's processing of user inputs.
- **Example**:

  ```plaintext
  "Translate the user's request into an SQL query but only if it relates to sales data."
  ```

##### Combining Frontend and Backend Prompts

- **Process**:
  1. User provides input.
  2. Backend prompt modifies or guides the LLM's processing.
  3. LLM generates the appropriate response or action.

#### AI Orchestrator Libraries

- **Purpose**: Simplify the integration and management of LLMs in applications.
- **Examples**:
  - **LangChain**
  - **Semantic Kernel**
  - **Haystack**
