## Early Experiments in Generative AI

### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

**Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** are a type of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) designed for sequential data processing. They have recurrent connections that allow information to persist across time steps, making them suitable for tasks like language modeling and text generation.

#### Structure of RNNs

- **Hidden State (\( h_t \))**: Captures information from previous time steps.
- **Input (\( x_t \))**: Current input at time \( t \).
- **Output (\( y_t \))**: Predicted output at time \( t \).

#### Mathematical Formulation

The hidden state and output are computed as:

\[
\begin{align*}
h_t &= \tanh(W_{hx} x_t + W_{hh} h_{t-1} + b_h) \\
y_t &= W_{yh} h_t + b_y
\end{align*}
\]

- \( W_{hx}, W_{hh}, W_{yh} \) are weight matrices.
- \( b_h, b_y \) are bias vectors.
- \( \tanh \) is the hyperbolic tangent activation function.

#### Limitations

- **Vanishing/Exploding Gradient Problem**: Difficulty in capturing long-range dependencies due to gradients becoming extremely small or large during backpropagation.
- **Sequential Processing**: Inability to process sequences in parallel, leading to inefficiencies with long sequences.

### Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

**Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks are a type of RNN that address the vanishing gradient problem by introducing gating mechanisms.

#### LSTM Cell Structure

- **Input Gate (\( i_t \))**: Controls how much new information flows into the cell state.
- **Forget Gate (\( f_t \))**: Decides what information to discard from the cell state.
- **Output Gate (\( o_t \))**: Determines the output based on the cell state.

#### Mathematical Formulation

\[
\begin{align*}
f_t &= \sigma(W_f [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f) \\
i_t &= \sigma(W_i [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i) \\
o_t &= \sigma(W_o [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o) \\
\tilde{C}_t &= \tanh(W_C [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_C) \\
C_t &= f_t * C_{t-1} + i_t * \tilde{C}_t \\
h_t &= o_t * \tanh(C_t)
\end{align*}
\]

- \( \sigma \) is the sigmoid activation function.
- \( * \) denotes element-wise multiplication.

#### Advantages Over RNNs

- Better at capturing long-term dependencies.
- Mitigates vanishing gradient problem through gating mechanisms.

### Limitations of Early Models

- **Inefficient Parallelization**: RNNs and LSTMs process sequences sequentially, hindering parallel computation.
- **Long-Range Dependencies**: Still struggle with extremely long sequences.
- **Scalability**: Not ideal for large-scale NLP tasks requiring massive parallel processing.

## Introducing the Transformer Architecture

The **Transformer** architecture, introduced by Vaswani et al. in the paper ["Attention Is All You Need"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) (2017), revolutionized NLP by eliminating the need for recurrence and convolutions.

### The Concept of Attention

**Attention mechanisms** allow models to focus on relevant parts of the input when generating each part of the output.

#### Intuition

- Mimics human reading by focusing on important words or phrases.
- Calculates weights representing the importance of different parts of the input.

### Self-Attention Mechanism

**Self-Attention** computes attention weights for each word in the input sequence with respect to all other words in the same sequence.

#### Purpose

- Captures dependencies regardless of the distance between words.
- Provides context for each word based on the entire sequence.

### Query, Key, and Value Matrices

The self-attention mechanism relies on three matrices:

- **Query (\( Q \))**: Represents the current focus.
- **Key (\( K \))**: Contains information about all words in the sequence.
- **Value (\( V \))**: Holds the actual word embeddings.

#### Computation Steps

1. **Compute Queries, Keys, and Values**:

   \[
   Q = XW^Q, \quad K = XW^K, \quad V = XW^V
   \]

   - \( X \) is the input embedding matrix.
   - \( W^Q, W^K, W^V \) are learned weight matrices.

2. **Calculate Attention Scores**:

   \[
   \text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left( \frac{QK^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}} \right) V
   \]

   - \( d_k \) is the dimension of the key vectors.
   - Softmax ensures the attention weights sum to 1.

#### Example

Suppose we have an input sequence: "The cat sat on the mat."

- **Tokenization**: Convert words to embeddings.
- **Compute \( Q, K, V \)** for each token.
- **Calculate attention weights** to determine the influence of each word on others.

### Mathematical Formulation

The scaled dot-product attention is defined as:

\[
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left( \frac{QK^\top}{\sqrt{d_k}} \right) V
\]

- **Explanation**:
  - \( QK^\top \) computes similarity between queries and keys.
  - Division by \( \sqrt{d_k} \) scales the scores to prevent extremely small gradients.
  - Softmax converts scores to probabilities.

### Transformer Architecture Components

#### Encoder Components

1. **Input Embedding**: Converts input tokens to embeddings.
2. **Positional Encoding**: Adds positional information to embeddings.

   - **Formula**:

     \[
     \text{PE}_{(pos, 2i)} = \sin\left( \frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d_{\text{model}}}} \right)
     \]

     \[
     \text{PE}_{(pos, 2i+1)} = \cos\left( \frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d_{\text{model}}}} \right)
     \]

   - \( pos \) is the position, \( i \) is the dimension index.

3. **Multi-Head Attention**: Allows the model to attend to information from different representation subspaces.

   - **Computation**:

     \[
     \text{MultiHead}(Q, K, V) = \text{Concat}(\text{head}_1, ..., \text{head}_h) W^O
     \]

     where each head is:

     \[
     \text{head}_i = \text{Attention}(Q W_i^Q, K W_i^K, V W_i^V)
     \]

4. **Add & Norm**: Adds input to output (residual connection) and applies layer normalization.
5. **Feed-Forward Network**: Applies two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.

   - **Formula**:

     \[
     \text{FFN}(x) = \max(0, xW_1 + b_1) W_2 + b_2
     \]

#### Decoder Components

1. **Output Embedding (Shifted Right)**: Ensures the model cannot peek at future tokens.
2. **Masked Multi-Head Attention**: Prevents attending to future positions by masking them.
3. **Encoder-Decoder Attention**: Allows the decoder to focus on relevant parts of the encoder's output.
4. **Add & Norm**: As in the encoder.
5. **Feed-Forward Network**: As in the encoder.
6. **Linear & Softmax Layer**: Generates probabilities over the vocabulary.

#### Fine-Tuning and RLHF

- **Fine-Tuning**: Adjusting the pre-trained model on a specific dataset for a particular task.

  - **Supervised Fine-Tuning**: Using labeled data to guide training.

- **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF)**:

  - **Purpose**: Align model outputs with human preferences.
  - **Process**:
    1. **Collect Human Feedback**: Obtain human ratings on model outputs.
    2. **Train a Reward Model (RM)**: Predict human preference scores.
    3. **Optimize LLM Using RL**: Use algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to maximize rewards.

#### Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

- **Algorithm** used in RLHF to fine-tune models.

- **Objective Function**:

  \[
  L^{CLIP}(\theta) = \hat{\mathbb{E}}_t \left[ \min \left( r_t(\theta) \hat{A}_t, \text{clip}(r_t(\theta), 1 - \epsilon, 1 + \epsilon) \hat{A}_t \right) \right]
  \]

  - \( r_t(\theta) \) is the ratio of new and old policy probabilities.
  - \( \hat{A}_t \) is the estimated advantage at time \( t \).
  - \( \epsilon \) is a hyperparameter controlling the clip range.

- **Methods**:
  - **Plug-ins**: Integrate with web APIs or databases.
  - **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combine LLMs with information retrieval systems.

#### Few-Shot Learning

- **Approach**: Provide the model with a few examples in the prompt (metaprompt) to guide its response.
- **Example**:

  ```plaintext
  Translate English to French:

  English: "Hello, how are you?"
  French: "Bonjour, comment ça va?"

  English: "What is your name?"
  French: "Comment vous appelez-vous?"

  English: "I would like a coffee."
  French: "Je voudrais un café."

  English: "Where is the library?"
  French:
  ```

#### Fine-Tuning

- **Process**: Update the model's parameters on a specific dataset.

##### Steps

1. **Prepare Dataset**:

   - Format: Pairs of prompts and desired completions.
   - Example:

     ```json
     {"prompt": "What is the capital of France?", "completion": "Paris."}
     ```

2. **Train the Model**:

   - Use optimization algorithms to minimize the loss on the new dataset.
   - Ensure not to overfit to the fine-tuning data.

3. **Evaluate**:

   - Test the fine-tuned model on validation data.
   - Compare performance with the base model.

##### Advantages

- Tailors the model to specific domains or styles.
- Requires less data and compute compared to training from scratch.
