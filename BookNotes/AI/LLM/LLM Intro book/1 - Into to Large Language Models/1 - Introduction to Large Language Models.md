## Understanding Large Language Models

Large Language Models (LLMs) are a class of deep learning models trained on vast amounts of text data. They are capable of performing a variety of natural language processing tasks such as recognizing, summarizing, translating, predicting, and generating text.

### Definition of Deep Learning

**Deep Learning** is a subset of machine learning characterized by neural networks with multiple layers—hence the term "deep." These networks automatically learn hierarchical representations of data, with each layer extracting increasingly abstract features from the input.

- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)**: Computational models inspired by the human brain, consisting of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers.
- **Layers in ANNs**:
  - **Input Layer**: Receives the input data.
  - **Hidden Layers**: Perform computations and extract features.
  - **Output Layer**: Produces the final output.

### Large Foundation Models (LFMs) and LLMs

LLMs are a subset of **Large Foundation Models (LFMs)**, which are pre-trained generative AI models adaptable for various specific tasks. LFMs are trained on extensive and diverse datasets, allowing them to capture general patterns across different data formats—text, images, audio, and video.

- **Key Characteristics of LFMs**:
  - **Versatility**: Adaptable to various tasks without compromising performance.
  - **Transfer Learning**: Ability to apply knowledge from pre-training to new tasks.
  - **Scale**: Contain millions or even billions of parameters.
  - **Generalization**: Perform well on unseen data across multiple tasks.

### Generative AI vs. Natural Language Understanding (NLU)

**Generative AI** aims to create new content, such as text, images, or music, whereas **NLU algorithms** focus on understanding existing natural language content.

- **Generative AI Applications**:
  - Text summarization
  - Text generation
  - Image captioning
  - Style transfer
- **NLU Applications**:
  - Chatbots
  - Question answering
  - Sentiment analysis
  - Machine translation

### Transfer Learning and Generalization
**Transfer Learning** involves leveraging knowledge gained from one task to improve performance on a related task. Foundation models excel in transfer learning due to their extensive pre-training on diverse datasets.

- **Advantages**:
  - **Efficiency**: Less data required for fine-tuning on specific tasks.
  - **Performance**: Improved accuracy due to pre-learned representations.
  - **Adaptability**: Quick adaptation to new domains.

## Under the Hood of an LLM

### Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)

LLMs are built upon ANNs, which process data through interconnected layers of neurons. The fundamental operations include:

- **Forward Pass**: Data moves from input to output layers.
- **Backward Pass (Backpropagation)**: Error gradients are propagated backward to update weights.

### Tokenization and Embeddings

To process text data, LLMs convert textual information into numerical form through:

#### Tokenization

**Tokenization** is the process of breaking text into smaller units called **tokens**.

```plaintext
Input Text: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

Tokens: ["The", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog", "."]
```

- **Types of Tokens**:
  - **Words**
  - **Subwords**
  - **Characters**

#### Embeddings

Each token is converted into a dense numerical vector called an **embedding**, which captures semantic meaning.

- **Word Embeddings**: Represent words in a continuous vector space where semantically similar words are closer together.

![Word Embeddings in 2D Space](https://example.com/figure1.5.png)

*Figure 1.5: Example of word embeddings in a 2D space*

- **Example**:

  The relationship between words can be captured mathematically:

  \[
  \text{King} - \text{Man} + \text{Woman} \approx \text{Queen}
  \]

- **Implementation with Python and NumPy**:

  ```python
  import numpy as np

  # Example embeddings (hypothetical vectors)
  king = np.array([0.8, 0.6])
  man = np.array([0.7, 0.3])
  woman = np.array([0.9, 0.5])

  # Compute the vector for 'Queen'
  queen = king - man + woman
  print("Embedding for 'Queen':", queen)
  ```

### Architecture of Neural Networks

![Architecture of a Generic ANN](https://example.com/figure1.6.png)

*Figure 1.6: High-level architecture of a generic ANN*

- **Input Layer**: Receives embeddings of tokens.
- **Hidden Layers**: Perform computations to extract features.
- **Output Layer**: Generates predictions, often using an activation function like Softmax.

### Training with Backpropagation

**Backpropagation** is the process of updating the network's weights based on the error between predicted and actual outputs.

- **Steps**:
  1. **Forward Pass**: Compute the output.
  2. **Compute Loss**: Calculate the error (e.g., cross-entropy loss).
  3. **Backward Pass**: Compute gradients of the loss with respect to weights.
  4. **Update Weights**: Adjust weights using gradient descent.

- **Mathematical Formulation**:

  - **Loss Function** \( L \):
    \[
    L = -\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i \log(\hat{y}_i)
    \]
    where:
    - \( y_i \): True label
    - \( \hat{y}_i \): Predicted probability

  - **Weight Update**:
    \[
    w_{new} = w_{old} - \eta \frac{\partial L}{\partial w}
    \]
    where \( \eta \) is the learning rate.

### Predicting the Next Word with Bayes' Theorem

LLMs predict the next word in a sequence by calculating the probability of potential candidates given the context.

#### Bayes' Theorem

Bayes' theorem describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions related to the event.

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

- **\( P(A|B) \)**: Posterior probability of event \( A \) given \( B \).
- **\( P(B|A) \)**: Likelihood of event \( B \) given \( A \).
- **\( P(A) \)**: Prior probability of event \( A \).
- **\( P(B) \)**: Marginal probability of event \( B \).

#### Application in LLMs

Given a prompt, the LLM computes the probability of each candidate word to determine the most likely next word.

- **Example**: Predicting the next word in "The cat is on the ___."

  1. **Candidates**: "table", "mat", "roof".
  2. **Compute Prior Probabilities** \( P(\text{word}) \).
  3. **Compute Likelihoods** \( P(\text{context}|\text{word}) \).
  4. **Compute Posterior Probabilities** using Bayes' theorem.
  5. **Select Word** with the highest posterior probability.

- **Mathematical Steps**:

  \[
  P(\text{word}|\text{context}) = \frac{P(\text{context}|\text{word}) \cdot P(\text{word})}{P(\text{context})}
  \]

  Since \( P(\text{context}) \) is the same for all candidates, we can simplify the selection by comparing the numerators.

- **Python Example**:

  ```python
  import numpy as np

  # Prior probabilities (based on training data frequency)
  P_table = 0.4
  P_mat = 0.35
  P_roof = 0.25

  # Likelihoods (based on context)
  P_context_given_table = 0.6
  P_context_given_mat = 0.8
  P_context_given_roof = 0.2

  # Compute numerators of posterior probabilities
  posterior_table = P_context_given_table * P_table
  posterior_mat = P_context_given_mat * P_mat
  posterior_roof = P_context_given_roof * P_roof

  # Choose the word with the highest posterior probability
  candidates = {
      'table': posterior_table,
      'mat': posterior_mat,
      'roof': posterior_roof
  }

  next_word = max(candidates, key=candidates.get)
  print("Predicted next word:", next_word)
  ```

  **Output**:

  ```
  Predicted next word: mat
  ```

### Softmax Function

The **Softmax function** converts raw output scores (logits) into probabilities that sum to 1, making them suitable for multi-class classification.

#### Definition

For a vector \( \mathbf{z} = [z_1, z_2, \dots, z_K] \):

\[
\sigma(z_i) = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_{j=1}^{K} e^{z_j}}
\]

- **Properties**:
  - \( 0 < \sigma(z_i) < 1 \)
  - \( \sum_{i=1}^{K} \sigma(z_i) = 1 \)

#### Usage in LLMs

In the output layer, the Softmax function ensures that the model's output can be interpreted as a probability distribution over possible next words.

- **Example**:

  ```python
  import numpy as np

  # Logits (raw model outputs)
  logits = np.array([2.0, 1.0, 0.1])

  # Compute Softmax probabilities
  def softmax(z):
      exp_z = np.exp(z - np.max(z))  # For numerical stability
      return exp_z / exp_z.sum()

  probabilities = softmax(logits)
  print("Probabilities:", probabilities)
  ```

  **Output**:

  ```
  Probabilities: [0.65900114 0.24243297 0.09856589]
  ```

- **Interpretation**:

  The word corresponding to the first logit has a 65.9% chance of being the next word.
