## Overview
In this section, we explore how to build a multimodal agent by integrating various single-purpose tools within LangChain. This agent, named **GPTuber**, will help generate video reviews, create related images, and prepare them for posting on social media—all with minimal human input. By leveraging structured tools such as YouTube search, transcription, and image generation, we will create a cohesive pipeline for seamless multimodal interactions.

### Key Steps to Build GPTuber:
1. **Search and transcribe a YouTube video based on user input.**
2. **Generate a review of the video in a user-defined style and length.**
3. **Create a related image for use in social media posts.**

## Step-by-Step Tool Integration

### 1. **YouTube Search Tool**
- **Purpose**: Searches YouTube for videos matching a query.
- **Import and Usage**:
    ```python
    from langchain.tools import YouTubeSearchTool

    tool = YouTubeSearchTool()
    result = tool.run("Avatar: The Way of Water,1")
    print(result)
    ```
- **Output**:
    ```plaintext
    "['/watch?v=d9MyW72ELq0&pp=ygUYQXZhdGFyOiBUaGUgV2F5IG9mIFdhdGVy']"
    ```
- **Explanation**: The output is a URL of the YouTube video, which can be appended to `https://youtube.com` to watch it.

### 2. **Custom YouTube Transcription Tool (Using Whisper)**
- **Purpose**: Transcribes audio from a YouTube video using OpenAI’s Whisper model.
- **Whisper Overview**:
    - **Transformer-based**: Transforms audio chunks into spectrograms for analysis.
    - **Encoder/Decoder Architecture**: Encodes audio to hidden states and decodes them into text, with task-specific tokens.

- **Code Example for Transcription**:
    ```python
    import openai

    audio_file = open("Avatar The Way of Water  Official Trailer.mp4", 'rb')
    result = openai.Audio.transcribe("whisper-1", audio_file)
    audio_file.close()
    print(result.text)
    ```
- **Output**:
    ```plaintext
    ♪ Dad, I know you think I'm crazy. But I feel her. I hear her heartbeat. She's so close. ♪ ...
    ```

### 3. **Combining YouTube Search and Transcription Tools**
- **Create Tools List and Initialize Agent**:
    ```python
    llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
    tools = [YouTubeSearchTool(), CustomYTTranscribeTool()]

    agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True)
    agent.run("search a video trailer of Avatar: the way of water. Return only 1 video. transcribe the youtube video and return the transcription.")
    ```
- **Example Output**:
    ```plaintext
    > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
    Action: youtube_search
    Observation: ['/watch?v=d9MyW72ELq0&pp=ygUYQXZhdGFyOiB0aGUgd2F5IG9mIHdhdGVy']
    Action: CustomeYTTranscribe
    Observation: ♪ Dad, I know you think I'm crazy. ...
    ```

## Adding Image Generation with DALL·E

### 4. **DALL·E Integration**
- **Purpose**: Generates images from text prompts.
- **Code Example**:
    ```python
    from langchain.agents import load_tools

    tools.append(load_tools(['dalle-image-generator'])[0])
    agent.run("Create an image of a halloween night. Return only the image url.")
    ```
- **Expected Output**:
    ```plaintext
    > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
    Observation: [link_to_the_blob]
    Final Answer: The image url is [link_to_the_blob]
    ```

### 5. **Generating a Review and Image for YouTube Content**
- **Agent Execution**:
    ```python
    agent.run("search a video trailer of Avatar: the way of water. Return only 1 video. transcribe the youtube video and return a review of the trailer. Generate an image based on the video transcription.")
    ```
- **Output**:
    ```plaintext
    > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
    Thought: I need to transcribe the video and write a review.
    Action: CustomeYTTranscribe
    Observation: ♪ Dad, I know you think I'm crazy. ...
    Action: Dall-E Image Generator
    Observation: [image_url]
    ```

### Full Example Chain
```python
# Add DALL·E tool to tools list
tools.append(load_tools(['dalle-image-generator'])[0])

# Initialize agent
agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True)

# Run agent with combined tasks
agent.run("Generate a review of the trailer of Avatar: The Way of Water. I want to publish it on Instagram.")
```
**Output**:
```plaintext
Final Answer: "Avatar: The Way of Water is an upcoming movie that promises ... #AvatarTheWayOfWater #MovieReview #ComingSoon"
```

## Customizing Agent Behavior with Prompt Engineering
- **Purpose**: Tailor the agent’s output style and functionality.
- **Custom Prompt**:
    ```python
    PREFIX = """
    You are an expert reviewer of movie trailers.
    You adapt the review style based on the user’s intended social media platform: Instagram, LinkedIn, or Facebook.
    ALWAYS search for the YouTube trailer and transcribe it.
    ALWAYS generate a review and an image based on the transcription.
    Use all available tools for these tasks.
    """
    agent = initialize_agent(
        tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True,
        agent_kwargs={'prefix': PREFIX}
    )
    ```

## Final Test with Custom Agent
```python
agent.run("Generate a review of the trailer of Avatar: The Way of Water. I want to publish it on Instagram.")
```
- **Output**:
    ```plaintext
    > Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
    Observation: Generated review and image.
    Final Answer: "Avatar: The Way of Water is a breathtaking cinematic experience... #ComingSoon"
    ```

## Summary
### Key Points:
- **Multimodal Agents**: Leverage different tools (YouTube search, Whisper transcription, DALL·E) to handle multiple types of media.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Custom prompts improve output relevance and style.
- **LangChain Integration**: Seamlessly combines tools within an agent framework to execute complex multimodal tasks.

### Next Steps:
- **Enhance the agent** by integrating more tools (e.g., for video editing or sentiment analysis).
- **Experiment with other image-generation models** or API-based tools to expand functionality.

This completes a comprehensive guide on building a multimodal agent capable of searching, transcribing, reviewing, and generating images, all while customizing output for specific platforms.
