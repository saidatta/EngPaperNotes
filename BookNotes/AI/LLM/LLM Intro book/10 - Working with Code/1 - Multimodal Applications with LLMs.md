## Overview
Building multimodal applications involves integrating various AI models and tools to create a system that can handle and process data across different formats, such as text, images, audio, and video. In this chapter, we cover how to construct such systems using LangChain, leveraging its components to create multimodal agents capable of dynamic interaction across different data types.

### Objectives
- Understand multimodality and its role in advancing toward AGI.
- Learn about existing Large Multimodal Models (LMMs).
- Develop a multimodal agent using single-modal tools in LangChain.
- Explore various approaches: out-of-the-box, custom agentic, and hard-coded sequential chains.

## Why Multimodality?
Multimodality refers to the ability of AI systems to process and generate outputs across multiple data formats. This enables richer, more human-like interactions where systems can respond with text, images, audio, or video as needed. The goal is to create agents that:
- Combine reasoning and execution across different AI models.
- Process inputs and outputs across varied formats (text, image, audio, etc.).
- Move toward AGI by integrating various sensory and cognitive capabilities.

### Definition: AGI
**Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)** refers to an AI system that can perform any intellectual task a human can. AGI implies the capability to learn, reason, plan, and solve problems across different domains while processing multimodal data. Achieving AGI is a significant milestone in AI research and development.

### AGI vs. Strong AI
- **AGI**: General human-like intelligence across various tasks.
- **Strong AI/Super AI**: AI systems that surpass human capabilities in specific or general tasks.

## Key Components of a Multimodal System
- **LLM as the Reasoning Engine**: Orchestrates the tasks and determines which tools/models to use.
- **Single-Modal Tools/Models**: Specialized models for tasks like text generation, image recognition, and audio synthesis.

### Illustration of Multimodal Integration
Imagine an AI system tasked with describing an image and reading it aloud. The LLM identifies the task and:
1. Uses an image recognition tool to analyze the image.
2. Generates a textual description of the image.
3. Passes the description to a text-to-speech tool to speak the description.

## Building a Multimodal Agent with LangChain
### Approaches to Multimodal Agents
1. **Out-of-the-Box Approach**: Using existing toolkits like Azure Cognitive Services for streamlined integration.
2. **Custom Agentic Approach**: Selecting and orchestrating individual models and tools.
3. **Hard-Coded Sequential Approach**: Building separate, task-specific chains combined into a single sequence.

### Prerequisites
- **Hugging Face account and user access token**
- **OpenAI account and user access token**
- **Python 3.7.1+**
- **Required Python Packages**:
  ```bash
  pip install langchain python-dotenv huggingface_hub streamlit pytube openai youtube_search
  ```

## Option 1: Out-of-the-Box Toolkit (Azure AI Services)
**Azure AI Services** (formerly Azure Cognitive Services) provide pre-built, cloud-based APIs that cover multiple AI domains: vision, speech, language, etc. They can be used directly or customized for specific use cases.

### Example: Building a Multimodal Agent with Azure AI Services

1. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   ```python
   import os
   from dotenv import load_dotenv
   load_dotenv()
   azure_api_key = os.environ['AZURE_API_KEY']
   azure_endpoint = os.environ['AZURE_ENDPOINT']
   ```

2. **Initialize the LangChain Agent with Azure AI Services**:
   ```python
   from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, Tool
   from langchain.llms import OpenAI
   from langchain.tools.azure_ai import AzureAIImageAnalysis, AzureAITTS

   # Initialize LLM
   llm = OpenAI(api_key=azure_api_key)

   # Define Azure AI tools
   image_analysis_tool = AzureAIImageAnalysis(api_key=azure_api_key, endpoint=azure_endpoint)
   tts_tool = AzureAITTS(api_key=azure_api_key, endpoint=azure_endpoint)

   # Combine tools into a multimodal agent
   tools = [image_analysis_tool, tts_tool]
   agent = initialize_agent(tools=tools, llm=llm, agent_type="zero-shot-react-description")
   ```

3. **Run the Agent**:
   ```python
   query = "Describe the contents of the given image and read the description aloud."
   response = agent.run(query)
   print(response)
   ```

## Option 2: Custom Agentic Approach
In this approach, individual tools and models are carefully selected, and custom tools can be defined to meet specific needs.

### Step-by-Step Implementation
1. **Select Single-Modal Models**:
   - **Image Recognition**: Use models like CLIP or DALLÂ·E.
   - **Text-to-Speech**: Integrate with TTS libraries like `pyttsx3` or `gTTS`.

2. **Define Custom Tools**:
   ```python
   from langchain.tools import Tool

   # Custom tool for image description
   def image_description_tool(image_path):
       # Code for analyzing image and generating a description
       pass

   # Custom tool for text-to-speech
   def tts_tool(text):
       # Code for converting text to speech
       pass

   # Register tools
   tools = [
       Tool(name="Image Description Tool", func=image_description_tool),
       Tool(name="TTS Tool", func=tts_tool)
   ]
   ```

3. **Integrate with LangChain Agent**:
   ```python
   agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent_type="zero-shot-react-description")
   response = agent.run("Analyze the image and convert the description to speech.")
   ```

### Example: Describe and Read Image
**Prompt**:
```python
query = "What is depicted in this image? Then, read it aloud using TTS."
agent.run(query)
```

**Response**:
- The agent analyzes the image, generates a description, and uses the TTS tool to read it aloud.

## Option 3: Hard-Coded Sequential Approach
In this approach, we build separate chains for each step and link them in a sequence.

### Sequential Chain Construction
```python
from langchain.chains import SimpleSequentialChain
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.chains.base import Chain

# Define image analysis chain
class ImageAnalysisChain(Chain):
    def _call(self, inputs):
        # Code for image analysis
        return {"description": "A scenic mountain view with a clear blue sky."}

# Define TTS chain
class TTSChain(Chain):
    def _call(self, inputs):
        # Code for TTS
        print("Speaking: " + inputs['description'])

# Combine chains into a sequential chain
image_chain = ImageAnalysisChain()
tts_chain = TTSChain()
sequential_chain = SimpleSequentialChain(chains=[image_chain, tts_chain])

# Run the chain
inputs = {"image_path": "path/to/image.jpg"}
sequential_chain.run(inputs)
```

### Pros and Cons
- **Pros**: Direct control over individual components and their integration.
- **Cons**: Less flexibility compared to agentic approaches.

## Advanced Techniques for Multimodal Integration
### Combining Audio Analysis with Image and Text
1. **Integrate Speech Recognition**:
   - Use libraries like `speech_recognition` for audio-to-text conversion.
   ```python
   import speech_recognition as sr
   recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
   with sr.AudioFile("audio_sample.wav") as source:
       audio = recognizer.record(source)
   text = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
   print("Recognized Text:", text)
   ```

2. **Combine Image and Audio Analysis**:
   - Develop a chain that processes both image and audio inputs and integrates their outputs for comprehensive responses.

### Custom Prompting for Multimodal Tasks
```python
prompt = """
Given an image, analyze the contents and identify key elements. 
Generate a textual report and convert it to speech. 
If audio input is provided, transcribe it and use it for additional context.
"""
agent.run(prompt)
```

## Conclusion
Integrating multiple AI models for multimodal tasks allows for the development of rich, dynamic applications capable of human-like interactions. LangChain provides the flexibility to build these agents using various approaches, from pre-built toolkits like Azure AI Services to custom-built models and hard-coded chains.
