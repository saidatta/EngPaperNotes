## Claude 2

### Overview

**Claude 2** stands for **Constitutional Large-scale Alignment via User Data and Expertise**. Developed by **Anthropic**, a company focused on AI safety and alignment, Claude 2 was announced in July 2023. It's a transformer-based LLM trained on a mixture of publicly available internet data and proprietary data.

### Constitutional AI (CAI)

A unique aspect of Claude 2 is its training method called **Constitutional AI (CAI)**.

#### Definition

**Constitutional AI (CAI)** is a training technique that aligns an AI model with human values and intentions by following a set of predefined principles, rather than relying solely on human feedback. The principles are derived from sources like the UN Declaration of Human Rights, trust and safety best practices, and empirical research.

#### Training Stages in CAI

1. **Self-Critique and Revision**:
   - The model is trained to critique and revise its own responses using the constitutional principles.
   - This process uses few-shot examples to guide the model.

2. **Reinforcement Learning with AI Feedback**:
   - Instead of human feedback, AI-generated feedback based on the principles is used.
   - The model is trained via reinforcement learning to choose more harmless outputs.

#### Illustration of CAI Training Process

## Mathematical Concepts

### Autoregressive Transformers

#### Definition

An **autoregressive transformer** predicts the next token in a sequence based on previous tokens. The model is trained to maximize the likelihood of the next token given the sequence of preceding tokens.

#### Mathematical Formulation

Given a sequence of tokens \( x = \{x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\} \), the probability of the sequence is:

\[
P(x) = \prod_{t=1}^{n} P(x_t | x_{<t})
\]

Where:

- \( P(x_t | x_{<t}) \) is the probability of token \( x_t \) given all previous tokens.

### Grouped-Query Attention (GQA)

#### Concept

**Grouped-Query Attention** reduces computational complexity by grouping query heads in the attention mechanism.

#### Advantages

- **Efficiency**: Reduces the number of computations in multi-head attention.
- **Speed**: Allows for faster inference times.

#### Mathematical Representation

- Let the total number of query heads be divided into \( G \) groups.
- Within each group, queries share the same key and value projections.

### Sliding-Window Attention (SWA)

#### Concept

**Sliding-Window Attention** enables the model to attend over a window of tokens rather than the entire sequence.

#### Advantages

- **Long Sequence Handling**: Efficiently processes longer sequences without quadratic scaling of computation.
- **Reduced Memory Usage**: Limits attention to a fixed-size window.

#### Mathematical Representation

- For each position \( i \) in the sequence, attention is computed over positions \( j \) such that:

\[
i - w \leq j \leq i
\]

Where:

- \( w \) is the window size.
