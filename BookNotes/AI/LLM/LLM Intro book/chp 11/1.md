# Staff+ Obsidian Notes: Fine-Tuning Large Language Models (LLMs)

## Introduction
Fine-tuning is an advanced technique within the field of machine learning that refines a **pretrained model** using **task-specific data** to improve its performance on domain-specific tasks. This chapter covers the theoretical foundations and practical steps for fine-tuning LLMs, with comprehensive code examples and mathematical explanations.

### Key Definitions
- **Fine-Tuning**: The process of updating the parameters of a pretrained model on a new task-specific dataset.
- **Transfer Learning**: Utilizing knowledge learned from one task to enhance performance on a related but different task.
- **Taxonomy**: The structured classification of terms and concepts within a domain, aiding in model adaptation to specialized tasks.

### Example Scenario: Medical Domain
Consider fine-tuning an LLM for medical consultations:
- **Taxonomy**: Categories such as diseases, symptoms, treatments, and patient demographics.
- **Model Requirement**: The model should be capable of understanding and generating contextually accurate responses within the medical field.

## The Concept of Fine-Tuning
### Transfer Learning Overview
Transfer learning involves the following steps:
1. **Feature Extraction**: Retain the base model's learned features and train a task-specific classifier on top of it.
2. **Fine-Tuning**: Unfreeze parts or all of the base model layers and train them along with the classifier to tailor the features for the new task.

**Mathematical Illustration**:
- Suppose \( \mathcal{L}_{\text{base}}(\theta) \) represents the loss function for a pretrained model with parameters \( \theta \). During fine-tuning, we optimize the new loss function \( \mathcal{L}_{\text{fine-tune}}(\theta, \phi) \), where \( \phi \) are the new parameters introduced for task-specific adaptation:
\[
\min_{\theta, \phi} \mathcal{L}_{\text{fine-tune}}(\theta, \phi)
\]

### Fine-Tuning Process
1. **Load the Pretrained Model and Tokenizer**:
   - Ensure compatibility between the model architecture and its tokenizer.
   - Example: BERT uses WordPiece tokenization, while GPT-2 uses byte-pair encoding (BPE).

   **Code Example**:
   ```python
   from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification

   tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
   model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased', num_labels=3)
   ```

2. **Prepare Task-Specific Dataset**:
   - Format: Input-output pairs (e.g., text-sentiment label for sentiment analysis).

   **Code Example**:
   ```python
   from datasets import load_dataset

   dataset = load_dataset('imdb')
   train_dataset = dataset['train'].map(lambda x: tokenizer(x['text'], padding='max_length', truncation=True), batched=True)
   ```

3. **Define the Task-Specific Head**:
   - Add a classification or generative layer on top of the model based on the task type.
   - For generative LLMs, output probabilities are computed for the next token in the sequence.

4. **Train the Model**:
   - Use an appropriate optimizer (e.g., AdamW) and learning rate scheduler for training.
   - Define a loss function (e.g., Cross-Entropy Loss for classification).

   **Code Example**:
   ```python
   from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments

   training_args = TrainingArguments(
       output_dir='./results',
       num_train_epochs=3,
       per_device_train_batch_size=8,
       evaluation_strategy="epoch",
       save_total_limit=1,
       logging_dir='./logs'
   )

   trainer = Trainer(
       model=model,
       args=training_args,
       train_dataset=train_dataset,
       eval_dataset=dataset['test']
   )

   trainer.train()
   ```

### Evaluation Metrics
- Common metrics include **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.
- **Mathematical Definition of F1-score**:
\[
\text{F1} = 2 \cdot \frac{\text{precision} \cdot \text{recall}}{\text{precision} + \text{recall}}
\]

### When to Fine-Tune an LLM
- Fine-tuning should be considered when:
  - The task is highly domain-specific (e.g., medical, legal).
  - Base model performance on the task is suboptimal.
  - There is sufficient domain-specific data available for training.

**Questions to Ask**:
- Does the LLM already perform well enough with prompt engineering alone?
- Is there enough high-quality data for the fine-tuning process?

## Preparing for Fine-Tuning
### Data Preparation
- Ensure the dataset is relevant, high-quality, and structured in input-output pairs.
- Preprocess data to handle inconsistencies (e.g., tokenization limits).

**Code Example for Tokenization**:
```python
def preprocess_function(examples):
    return tokenizer(examples['text'], truncation=True, padding='max_length')

encoded_dataset = dataset.map(preprocess_function, batched=True)
```

### Training Considerations
- **Hardware Requirements**: GPUs are recommended for efficient training. TPUs may be used for large-scale training.
- **Batch Size and Learning Rate**: Tune these parameters for optimal performance.
- **Training Time**: Depends on model size, dataset size, and computational resources.

## Fine-Tuning LLMs with Hugging Face
### Step-by-Step Implementation
1. **Install Required Packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install transformers datasets accelerate
   ```

2. **Load the Model and Tokenizer**:
   ```python
   from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

   model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained('gpt2')
   tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2')
   ```

3. **Prepare the Dataset**:
   ```python
   from datasets import load_dataset

   dataset = load_dataset('your_dataset')
   def tokenize_function(examples):
       return tokenizer(examples['text'], truncation=True, padding='max_length')

   tokenized_datasets = dataset.map(tokenize_function, batched=True)
   ```

4. **Configure Training Arguments**:
   ```python
   from transformers import TrainingArguments

   training_args = TrainingArguments(
       output_dir="./fine_tuned_model",
       per_device_train_batch_size=4,
       num_train_epochs=3,
       logging_steps=100,
       save_steps=500,
       save_total_limit=2,
       evaluation_strategy="epoch"
   )
   ```

       args=training_args,
       train_dataset=tokenized_datasets['train'],
       eval_dataset=tokenized_datasets['validation']
   )
   trainer.train()
   ```

6. **Evaluate the Model**:
   ```python
   metrics = trainer.evaluate()
   print(metrics)
   ```

## Hosting and Deployment Strategies
### Hosting Fine-Tuned Models
- **Hugging Face Model Hub**:
   - Deploy your fine-tuned model to Hugging Face's platform for easy sharing and usage.
   - **Command**:
   ```bash
   huggingface-cli login
   ```
   **Code**:
   ```python
   model.push_to_hub("username/your-model-name")
   tokenizer.push_to_hub("username/your-model-name")
   ```

- **Cloud Deployment**:
   - Use services like **AWS SageMaker**, **Google AI Platform**, or **Azure Machine Learning** for scalable deployment.
   - Dockerize the model for portability and use Kubernetes for orchestration if needed.

### Example Deployment Architecture
1. **Containerize the Model**: Use a `Dockerfile` with `transformers` and the fine-tuned model.
2. **Deploy to a Cloud Platform**: Utilize Kubernetes or serverless services like AWS Lambda for scaling based on traffic.
