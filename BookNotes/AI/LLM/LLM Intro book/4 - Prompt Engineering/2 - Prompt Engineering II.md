## Asking for Justification

### Understanding the Need

LLMs generate text by predicting the next token based on the preceding tokens, without revisiting or verifying their prior outputs. This can lead to **plausible but incorrect answers**, presented confidently. Without specific references or reasoning, it's challenging to validate the correctness of these responses.

By **asking for justification**, we:

- Encourage the model to **reflect on its reasoning**.
- Provide users with transparency into the **model's thought process**.
- Potentially **reduce errors** by prompting the model to reconsider its answers.

### Example Implementation

Let's instruct the LLM to solve a riddle and provide a clear justification of its answer.

#### Code Example

```python
import os
import openai

# Set up OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = os.environ.get('OPENAI_API_KEY')

# Define the system message (metaprompt)
system_message = """
You are an AI assistant specialized in solving riddles.
Given a riddle, solve it the best you can.
Provide a clear justification of your answer and the reasoning behind it.
Riddle:
"""

# Define the riddle
riddle = """
What has a face and two hands, but no arms or legs?
"""

# Generate the response
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",  # Use the desired model
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": system_message},
        {"role": "user", "content": riddle},
    ]
)

# Print the assistant's response
print(response['choices'][0]['message']['content'])
```

#### Output

```
The answer to this riddle is a clock.

**Justification:**

- **Face**: A clock has a "face" which displays the numbers or time markers.
- **Two Hands**: It has two "hands" — the hour hand and the minute hand — that point to the numbers to indicate time.
- **No Arms or Legs**: While it has "hands," these are not actual limbs; it doesn't have arms or legs like a living creature.

Therefore, a clock fits the description perfectly.
```

### Analyzing the Output

- The model provides the **correct answer**: a clock.
- It includes a **detailed justification**, linking each part of the riddle to the characteristics of a clock.
- The reasoning is logical and helps verify the correctness of the answer.

### Benefits of Justification

- **Enhances Reliability**: Encourages the model to check its own reasoning, potentially catching errors.
- **Increases Transparency**: Users gain insight into how the model arrived at its answer.
- **Facilitates Verification**: Makes it easier to identify and correct mistakes in the reasoning process.

---

## Generating Multiple Outputs and Selecting the Best One

### The Limitations of LLMs

LLMs predict the next token based on the previous ones **without looking back**. If an incorrect token is generated early, it can lead the entire response astray.

- **No Self-Correction**: LLMs typically don't revisit or revise their outputs.
- **Error Propagation**: Early mistakes can compound over the response.

### Strategy to Overcome Errors

By **generating multiple responses** and then selecting the best one, we can:

- **Expand the Solution Space**: Increase the chances of producing a correct answer.
- **Leverage Model Evaluation**: Use the LLM's own reasoning to compare and select the most plausible response.

### Example Implementation

We'll modify the previous example to generate three possible answers and then choose the best one.

#### Code Example

```python
import os
import openai

# Set up OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = os.environ.get('OPENAI_API_KEY')

# Define the system message (metaprompt)
system_message = """
You are an AI assistant specialized in solving riddles.
Given a riddle, you have to generate three answers to the riddle.
For each answer, be specific about the reasoning you made.
Then, among the three answers, select the one that is most plausible given the riddle.
Riddle:
"""

# Define the riddle
riddle = """
What has a face and two hands, but no arms or legs?
"""

# Generate the response
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",  # Use the desired model
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": system_message},
        {"role": "user", "content": riddle},
    ]
)

# Print the assistant's response
print(response['choices'][0]['message']['content'])
```

#### Output

```
**Answer 1: A Clock**

*Reasoning*: A clock has a "face" which displays the numbers, and "two hands" — the hour hand and the minute hand. It doesn't have arms or legs.

---

**Answer 2: A Watch**

*Reasoning*: Similar to a clock, a watch has a face and two hands to tell time. It also lacks arms and legs.

---

**Answer 3: A Mirror with Handles**

*Reasoning*: A decorative mirror might have a face (the reflective surface) and two handles, but no arms or legs.

---

**Most Plausible Answer:**

The most plausible answer is **Answer 1: A Clock**.

*Explanation*: A clock perfectly fits the description by having a face and two hands (hour and minute hands) and lacking arms and legs. While a watch is similar, it's often associated with being worn on a wrist (implying an arm). The mirror with handles is a less common interpretation and doesn't universally apply.

Therefore, **a clock** is the best answer to this riddle.
```

### Analyzing the Output

- The model generates **three potential answers** with reasoning for each.
- It **evaluates** the answers and selects the most plausible one.
- The final selection is well-justified, showing the model's comparative reasoning.

### Discussion on the Approach

- **Mitigates Single-Point Failure**: By generating multiple options, the chance that at least one is correct increases.
- **Utilizes Model's Strengths**: The LLM's ability to reason and compare is leveraged to improve accuracy.
- **Applicability**: Useful in scenarios where the first response may not be reliable or when creativity is desired.

## Structuring the Metaprompt

### Impact of Structure on Performance

The **order** and **strength** of statements in the metaprompt (system message) can significantly affect the model's behavior.

- **Priority of Instructions**: Important instructions should be placed at the beginning.
- **Clarity**: Ambiguous instructions can lead to unpredictable outputs.
- **Specificity**: Detailed guidelines help the model understand the task better.

### Guidelines for Effective Metaprompts

1. **Be Explicit**: Clearly state the task and expectations.
2. **Order Matters**: Place critical instructions at the top.
3. **Use Strong Language**: Words like "must" or "always" emphasize importance.
4. **Avoid Ambiguity**: Be precise in your wording.
5. **Test and Iterate**: Experiment with different structures to see what works best.

**Example:**

```python
system_message = """
You are an AI assistant that must always provide factual and concise answers.
First, understand the user's question thoroughly.
Then, provide a step-by-step solution if applicable.
Do not include any unnecessary information or personal opinions.
"""
```

- **Strong Directives**: "must always," "do not"
- **Sequential Instructions**: Guides the model through the desired process

## Mathematical Concepts

### Token Prediction Mechanism in LLMs

LLMs generate text by predicting the next token based on the sequence of previous tokens.

**Mathematical Representation:**

- Let \( X = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n-1}) \) be the sequence of previous tokens.
- The probability of the next token \( x_n \) is given by:

  \[
  P(x_n | X) = P(x_n | x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n-1})
  \]

- The model aims to maximize the likelihood of the next token:

  \[
  x_n = \arg\max_{x} P(x | x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n-1})
  \]

### Probability Space and Sampling Methods

When generating text, the model operates within a probability distribution over possible tokens.

- **Single Output Generation**: The model selects the most probable token at each step (greedy decoding), which may not always lead to the best overall output.
- **Sampling Methods**: Introduce randomness to explore more of the probability space.

#### Temperature Sampling

- **Controls the randomness** of the token selection.
- **Formula**:

  \[
  P_{\text{scaled}}(x_i) = \frac{\exp{\left(\frac{\log P(x_i)}{T}\right)}}{\sum_j \exp{\left(\frac{\log P(x_j)}{T}\right)}}
  \]

  where:
  - \( P(x_i) \) is the original probability of token \( x_i \).
  - \( T \) is the temperature parameter.
    - \( T < 1 \): Less randomness (sharper distribution).
    - \( T > 1 \): More randomness (flatter distribution).

#### Top-k Sampling

- **Limits the selection** to the top \( k \) most probable tokens.
- Redistributes the probability mass among these tokens.

#### Nucleus (Top-p) Sampling

- Considers the **smallest possible set of tokens** whose cumulative probability exceeds a threshold \( p \).

  \[
  \text{Find minimal set } S \text{ such that } \sum_{x_i \in S} P(x_i) \geq p
  \]

- Allows dynamic adjustment of the number of tokens considered based on the distribution.
