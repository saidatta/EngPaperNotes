## Introduction

Advanced prompt engineering techniques enable LLMs to perform complex reasoning tasks by guiding them to think through problems methodically. The key methods we'll explore are:

- **Few-Shot Learning**: Providing examples to guide the model.
- **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**: Encouraging step-by-step reasoning.
- **ReAct**: Combining reasoning and action by interacting with external tools.

---

## Few-Shot Learning

### Concept

**Few-Shot Learning** involves providing the model with a few examples (shots) of the desired input-output pairs within the prompt. This technique helps the model generalize the pattern and produce appropriate responses without fine-tuning the model's parameters.

### Implementation

- **Structure**: Include examples in the prompt that demonstrate the task.
- **Shots**: The number of examples can vary (one-shot, few-shot).
- **No Fine-Tuning**: The model remains unchanged; the prompt guides its behavior.

### Example: Marketing Taglines

**Objective**: Generate a tagline for a new product line of climbing shoes named **Elevation Embrace**.

#### Prompt

```python
system_message = """
You are an AI marketing assistant. You help users create taglines for new product names.
Given a product name, produce a tagline similar to the following examples:

- Peak Pursuit - Conquer Heights with Comfort
- Summit Steps - Your Partner for Every Ascent
- Crag Conquerors - Step Up, Stand Tall

Product name:
"""
```

#### User Input

```python
product_name = "Elevation Embrace"
```

#### Code Implementation

```python
import openai

openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",  # or any other suitable model
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": system_message},
        {"role": "user", "content": product_name},
    ]
)

print(response['choices'][0]['message']['content'])
```

#### Expected Output

```
Elevation Embrace - Reach New Heights, Embrace the Journey
```

**Explanation**:

- The model follows the pattern from the examples.
- Maintains style and length consistency.
- Generates a creative and relevant tagline.

### Example: Sentiment Analysis

**Objective**: Classify text as **Positive** or **Negative** using few-shot examples.

#### Prompt

```python
system_message = """
You are a binary classifier for sentiment analysis.
Given a text, classify it into one of two categories: Positive or Negative.
You can use the following texts as examples:

Text: "I love this product! It's fantastic and works perfectly."
Positive

Text: "I'm really disappointed with the quality of the food."
Negative

Text: "This is the best day of my life!"
Positive

Text: "I can't stand the noise in this restaurant."
Negative

ONLY return the sentiment as output (without punctuation).
Text:
"""
```

#### Dataset Preparation

Using the IMDb dataset from Kaggle:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('movie.csv', encoding='utf-8')

# Map labels to 'Positive' and 'Negative'
df['label'] = df['label'].replace({0: 'Negative', 1: 'Positive'})

# Sample 10 random entries
df = df.sample(n=10, random_state=42)
```

#### Code Implementation

```python
def process_text(text):
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",  # or another model
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": system_message},
            {"role": "user", "content": text},
        ]
    )
    return response['choices'][0]['message']['content'].strip()

df['predicted'] = df['text'].apply(process_text)
```

#### Results

| text                                              | label     | predicted |
|---------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|
| "An amazing movie with a compelling storyline..." | Positive  | Positive  |
| "I was bored throughout the entire film..."       | Negative  | Negative  |
| ...                                               | ...       | ...       |

**Analysis**:

- The model correctly classifies the sentiments.
- Few-shot examples effectively guide the model.

### Mathematical Explanation

Few-shot learning leverages the model's ability to perform **in-context learning**. By providing examples, we condition the model's output distribution.

- **Conditional Probability**:

  \[
  P(\text{Output} | \text{Input + Examples}) \approx P(\text{Output} | \text{Input})
  \]

- The model uses the examples to infer the mapping between inputs and outputs.

## Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting

### Concept

**Chain-of-Thought Prompting** encourages the model to generate intermediate reasoning steps before providing the final answer. This technique improves the model's ability to handle complex reasoning tasks.

### Implementation

- **Guidance**: Include explicit steps or reasoning processes in the prompt.
- **Transparency**: The model's reasoning is visible, allowing for verification.

### Example: Solving Equations

**Objective**: Solve first-degree equations step by step.

#### Prompt

```python
system_message = """
To solve a first-degree equation, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Equation:** Recognize the form "ax + b = c".
2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - Subtract or add constants to both sides.
   - Divide both sides by the coefficient of 'x'.
3. **Simplify:** Perform arithmetic operations.
4. **Solve for 'x':** Obtain 'x = value'.
5. **Check Your Solution:** Substitute back into the original equation.
6. **Express the Solution:** Present the solution clearly.
7. **Consider Special Cases:** Note if 'a' equals zero.

Equation:
"""
```

#### User Input

```python
equation = "3x + 5 = 11"
```

#### Code Implementation

```python
response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",  # or another model
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": system_message},
        {"role": "user", "content": equation},
    ]
)

print(response['choices'][0]['message']['content'])
```

#### Expected Output

```
1. Identify the Equation:
   The equation is 3x + 5 = 11.

2. Isolate the Variable:
   - Subtract 5 from both sides:
     3x + 5 - 5 = 11 - 5
     Simplifies to:
     3x = 6
   - Divide both sides by 3:
     3x / 3 = 6 / 3
     Simplifies to:
     x = 2

3. Simplify:
   Equation is simplified.

4. Solve for 'x':
   x = 2

5. Check Your Solution:
   Substitute x = 2 into the original equation:
   3(2) + 5 = 11
   6 + 5 = 11
   11 = 11 (True)

6. Express the Solution:
   The solution is x = 2.

7. Consider Special Cases:
   No special cases; 'a' ≠ 0.
```

**Explanation**:

- The model follows each step meticulously.
- Demonstrates understanding and reasoning.

## ReAct (Reason and Act)

### Concept

**ReAct** combines reasoning and acting by allowing the model to interact with external tools or environments. It generates reasoning traces and actions, receives observations, and adapts its plan dynamically.

### Implementation

- **Reasoning Steps**: The model thinks about the problem.
- **Actions**: Performs operations (e.g., web searches, calculations).
- **Observations**: Receives results from actions.
- **Loop**: Continues the Thought → Action → Observation cycle until a conclusion is reached.

### Example: Using External Tools

**Objective**: Find information about upcoming Olympic athletes using web search capabilities.

#### Setup

- **Libraries**: Use `LangChain` and `SerpAPI`.
- **Model**: GPT-3.5-turbo or similar.
- **Agent Type**: `ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION` provided by LangChain.

#### Code Implementation

```python
import os
from langchain import SerpAPIWrapper
from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.tools import Tool

# Load API keys
openai.api_key = os.environ.get('OPENAI_API_KEY')
serpapi_api_key = os.environ.get('SERPAPI_API_KEY')

# Initialize the model
model = ChatOpenAI(model_name='gpt-3.5-turbo')

# Initialize the search tool
search = SerpAPIWrapper(serpapi_api_key=serpapi_api_key)

# Define tools
tools = [
    Tool.from_function(
        func=search.run,
        name="Search",
        description="Useful for answering questions about current events"
    )
]

# Initialize the agent
agent_executor = initialize_agent(
    tools=tools,
    llm=model,
    agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
    verbose=True
)
```

#### User Query

```python
question = "Who are the Italian male athletes for climbing at the Paris 2024 Olympics?"
```

#### Running the Agent

```python
response = agent_executor(question)
```

#### Sample Output with Intermediate Steps

```
Thought: I should search for recent updates on Italian male climbers qualified for the Paris 2024 Olympics.

Action: Search
Action Input: "Italian male climbers qualified for Paris 2024 Olympics"

Observation: Matteo Zurloni has secured a spot for the Paris 2024 Olympics in climbing.

Thought: With the information available, Matteo Zurloni is confirmed.

Final Answer: Matteo Zurloni is one of the Italian male climbers qualified for the Paris 2024 Olympics.
```

**Explanation**:

- The model performs web searches to gather up-to-date information.
- It iteratively refines its query based on observations.
- Demonstrates dynamic reasoning and acting.

### Comparison with CoT

- **CoT**: Focuses on internal reasoning without external interactions.
- **ReAct**: Incorporates external actions and observations into the reasoning process.
