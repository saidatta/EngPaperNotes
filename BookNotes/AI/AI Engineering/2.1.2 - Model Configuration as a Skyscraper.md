1. **Number of Transformer Blocks** (the “floors”)
   - Think of each **Transformer block** as a **floor** in a skyscraper.
   - A **taller** skyscraper (more floors) means more layers of processing.  
   - For example, a 32-floor skyscraper has 32 Transformer blocks, while an 80-floor skyscraper has 80.

2. **Model Dimension** (the “floor width”)
   - Each floor in our skyscraper has a certain **width** (how big the usable area is on that floor).
   - A **wider** floor (larger model dimension) can hold more “offices” or “workers” (neurons) to process information.

3. **Feedforward Dimension** (the “depth of each floor”)
   - Within each floor, you might have a **deep office space** where more complex operations take place (the feedforward layers).
   - If the **floor plan** is deeper (a larger feedforward dimension), that floor can handle more complex or more extensive internal work before passing information on to the next floor.

4. **Vocabulary Size** (the “languages supported by the building”)
   - Imagine your skyscraper houses international offices.  
   - A **bigger vocabulary** is like having staff who speak many different languages.  
   - The **final layer** (output layer or “model head”) can produce outputs across all these languages (token choices).

5. **Context Length** (the “memory capacity per floor”)
   - Context length is like how **far into the past** each floor can recall details.
   - A **longer context length** means each “office” can keep track of more documents or conversations before handing them off.  
   - If the skyscraper floors can remember more, the building overall can handle more extended sequences of data.

## Putting It All Together

- **Token + Positional Embeddings** = Your “visitors and their ID badges”  
  - Before they enter the skyscraper, each visitor (token) gets an ID badge (embedding) plus a position label (positional embedding) so the building knows exactly who arrived first, second, third, and so on.

- **Stack of Transformer Blocks** = The “floors” in the skyscraper  
  - Each floor (block) contains two main “departments”: 
    1. **Attention** (where “offices” figure out which visitors or documents from lower floors are most important).  
    2. **MLP** (the deeper, specialized office space that transforms the information).

- **Output Layer** = The “reception desk at the top”  
  - After going through every floor, the visitors (input tokens) end up at the penthouse.  
  - Here, the final “reception desk” translates all that internal skyscraper processing into actual results—essentially turning hidden states into **probabilities** for each possible word/token in the vocabulary.

## Parameter Count Drivers = “Size and Complexity of the Skyscraper”

1. **Number of Floors (Transformer Blocks)**  
   - A taller building with more floors naturally has more *rooms/offices* to house parameters.

2. **Floor Width (Model Dim)**  
   - A wider floor accommodates more “offices” on each floor, so more parameters.

3. **Depth of Each Floor (Feedforward Dim)**  
   - If each floor is deeper with more interior offices, that again boosts parameter count.

4. **Vocabulary Size**  
   - If your building supports more output languages (bigger vocab), you need more parameters to handle all those possible outputs.

Hence, if you build a **taller**, **wider** skyscraper with **deeper** floors and serve many “languages,” you end up with a **much larger** parameter count overall.

### The Metaphor at a Glance

| Item                               | Skyscraper Metaphor                         |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Transformer Blocks**             | Floors                                      |
| **Model Dimension (Hidden Dim)**   | Floor width (number of offices)             |
| **Feedforward Dimension**          | Depth of each floor (back offices)          |
| **Vocabulary Size**                | Number of languages the building can serve  |
| **Context Length**                 | Memory/record capacity within each floor    |

Just as a bigger, taller skyscraper with more floors, wider halls, and deeper rooms can accommodate more workers and handle more tasks, a larger model with more layers, bigger hidden sizes, and bigger feedforward layers can process more complex sequences of data and produce richer outputs.
