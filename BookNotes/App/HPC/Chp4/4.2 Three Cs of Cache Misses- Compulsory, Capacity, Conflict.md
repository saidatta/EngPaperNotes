### Understanding Cache Misses and Compressed Data Representations for High-Performance Computing (HPC)
Cache efficiency plays a pivotal role in the performance of high-performance computing (HPC) systems. The cost of a cache miss can be significant, with delays ranging from 100 to 400 CPU cycles. During this period, many floating-point operations (FLOPs) could be executed. Understanding how to minimize cache misses is essential to optimizing computation speed. This section explores the **Three Cs** of cache misses: Compulsory, Capacity, and Conflict.
##### **Overview of Cache Architecture**
When data is loaded into the CPU, it’s fetched in blocks called **cache lines**, typically 64 bytes long. The data is placed in specific cache locations determined by its memory address. Cache designs can be:
- **Direct-mapped cache**: A single cache location for each memory address. This is important when two arrays get mapped to the same location. With a direct-mapped cache, only one array can be cached at a time
- **N-way set associative cache**: Multiple cache locations to reduce conflicts. With regular, predictable memory accesses of large arrays, it is possible to _prefetch data_. That is, you can issue an instruction to preload data before it is needed so that it’s already in the cache. This can be done either in hardware or in software by the compiler.

**ASCII Visualization of Cache Layout**:
```text
+------------+------------+------------+
|  Cache Line 0   |   Cache Line 1    |   Cache Line N   |
|   Data Block    |   Data Block      |   Data Block     |
+------------+------------+------------+
```
#### **The Three Cs of Cache Misses**
1. **Compulsory Misses**:
   - Occur when data is accessed for the first time.
   - Inevitable unless data is pre-loaded.
2. **Capacity Misses**:
   - Happen when the cache cannot contain all the data needed for computation.
   - Result from limited cache size leading to data eviction.
3. **Conflict Misses**:
   - Occur when multiple data blocks compete for the same cache slot.
   - Happens even if there’s enough space in the cache but due to specific mapping.
##### **Cache Thrashing**
Cache thrashing occurs when repeated cache misses force the CPU to continually load and evict data, severely impacting performance. The key to preventing cache thrashing is to understand these cache misses and to optimize data movement.
#### **Example: Analyzing Cache Misses in a Stencil Kernel**
Consider the blur operator in the Krakatau simulation. It involves high data movement and memory access patterns that can be optimized by minimizing cache misses.
**C Code Example: Stencil Kernel for Blur Operator**
```c
#define N 2000

void blur_operator(double x[N][N], double y[N][N]) {
    for (int i = 1; i < N - 1; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j < N - 1; j++) {
            y[i][j] = 0.2 * (x[i][j] + x[i+1][j] + x[i-1][j] + x[i][j+1] + x[i][j-1]);
        }
    }
}
```
**Performance Analysis**:
- **Total Memory Used**: `2000 x 2000 x (5 references + 1 store) x 8 bytes = 192 MB`
- **Compulsory Memory Loaded and Stored**: `2002 x 2002 x 8 bytes x 2 arrays = 64.1 MB`
- **Arithmetic Intensity**: `5 FLOPs * 2000 * 2000 / 64.1 Mbytes = 0.312 FLOPs/byte`
### **Rust Implementation of the Stencil Kernel**
Using Rust for better performance and safety with low-level memory operations.

```rust
fn blur_operator(x: &mut [[f64; 2000]; 2000], y: &mut [[f64; 2000]; 2000]) {
    for i in 1..1999 {
        for j in 1..1999 {
            y[i][j] = 0.2 * (x[i][j] + x[i + 1][j] + x[i - 1][j] + x[i][j + 1] + x[i][j - 1]);
        }
    }
}
```
**Performance Model Analysis**:
- **Operation Intensity**: 0.247 FLOPs per byte.
- **Compulsory Upper Bound**: Set by cache limitations and cold cache scenarios.
The **Roofline Plot** in Figure 4.10 illustrates how memory access patterns constrain performance, even if computational FLOPs are optimized.
### **Improving Cache Usage: Spatial and Temporal Locality**
- **Spatial Locality**: Data elements in nearby memory locations accessed close together.
- **Temporal Locality**: Reuse of recently accessed data in a short time period.
#### **Example of Spatial and Temporal Locality in Cache Access**
**Rust Example for Spatial and Temporal Locality Optimization**
```rust
fn optimize_cache_usage(data: &mut [[f64; 2000]; 2000]) {
    for i in 0..2000 {
        for j in 0..2000 {
            let _temp = data[i][j];
            data[i][j] = _temp + 1.0; // Temporal locality: immediate reuse of data.
        }
    }
}
```
#### **Introducing the Fourth C: Coherency**
**Cache Coherency** ensures that all processors have the most recent view of memory when working in parallel. When data is updated in one cache, all other caches must reflect this change, leading to potential cache update storms and memory traffic congestion.
### **4.3 Simple Performance Models: Case Study in Sparse Data Structures**
Compressed sparse data structures allow for more efficient memory usage and faster computations in HPC.
#### **Types of Sparse Data Representations**
1. **Cell-Centric Compressed Sparse Storage**:
   - Organizes data around each cell, storing non-zero elements in a compact form.
   - Achieves significant memory savings and improved cache performance.
**Rust Example for Cell-Centric Sparse Data Structure**
```rust
struct CompressedCell {
    materials: Vec<MaterialEntry>,
}

struct MaterialEntry {
    material_id: usize,
    density: f64,
}

fn compute_density(cells: &Vec<CompressedCell>) {
    for cell in cells {
        let mut density_sum = 0.0;
        for entry in &cell.materials {
            density_sum += entry.density;
        }
    }
}
```
2. **Material-Centric Compressed Sparse Storage**:
   - Groups data by materials, improving performance in scenarios where material-based operations dominate.
**Rust Example for Material-Centric Sparse Data Structure**
```rust
struct MaterialSet {
    cells: Vec<usize>,
    densities: Vec<f64>,
}

fn compute_pressure(materials: &Vec<MaterialSet>, volume: f64) {
    for material in materials {
        for density in &material.densities {
            let pressure = density * volume; // Compute pressure using ideal gas law.
        }
    }
}
```
