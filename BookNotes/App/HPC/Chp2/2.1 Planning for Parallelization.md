### Overview of Planning for Parallel Projects
Developing a parallel application or transitioning an existing one to a parallel framework requires careful planning, version control, and a thorough understanding of both hardware and software constraints. The process can be broken down into a series of incremental steps to systematically introduce parallelism, as illustrated in **Figure 2.1**. Implementing these steps in an agile manner helps manage complexity and ensure robustness at each stage.

**Figure 2.1: Parallel Development Workflow**
```
1. Application Preparation
2. Analyze and Benchmark
3. Implement Parallelism Incrementally
4. Test and Validate
5. Commit and Repeat
```

### Key Steps for Parallel Project Preparation
1. **Set up version control** to track changes.
2. **Develop a test suite** to validate correctness.
3. **Clean up existing code** to ensure modularity and portability.
4. **Benchmark and profile the application** to identify computational bottlenecks.

These steps ensure a structured approach, reducing the risk of introducing bugs or performance regressions when applying parallelization.

## 2.1 Approaching a New Project: The Preparation Phase

### Components of the Preparation Phase

**Figure 2.2: Preparation Components**
```
Version Control -> Code Testing -> Code Cleanup -> Portability Check
```
#### 2.1.1 Version Control: Creating a Safety Vault for Your Parallel Code

Version control is crucial for managing the iterative process of parallelization. Frequent commits, descriptive commit messages, and a structured workflow (e.g., pull request model) ensure that changes are traceable and reversible.

**Best Practices for Commit Messages:**
- **Bad Message**: "Fixed a bug"
- **Good Message**: "Fixed race condition in OpenMP version of blur operator"
- **Great Message**: 
  ```
  [Issue #21] Fixed race condition in OpenMP version of blur operator.
  - Introduced OMP BARRIER to synchronize threads before calculating weighted stencil sum.
  - Tested and validated on GCC, Intel, and PGI compilers.
  ```

### Rust Code Example: Integrating Git in Parallel Projects

Using Git for version control with Rust projects:
```bash
# Initialize Git repository
git init
git add .
git commit -m "[Issue #21] Initial commit for parallelization with Rayon in Rust"
```

### Version Control Tips
- **Frequent Commits**: Avoid the pitfall of delaying commits until major changes are complete.
- **Detailed Messages**: Include issue numbers and specific details about the changes.
- **Branching Strategy**: Use feature branches for parallelization efforts to isolate changes from the main branch.

### 2.1.2 Test Suites: Ensuring Robustness and Reliability

Test suites validate that parallel code changes do not introduce bugs or alter the expected results. Different compilers and hardware can lead to variations in the output, so using tools like `numdiff` and `ndiff` can help quantify acceptable differences.

**Example: Krakatau Ocean Wave Simulation**
- **Test for validated results**: Ensure consistency across different compilers (GCC vs. Intel).
- **Numerical Diff Tools**: 
  - `numdiff` (https://www.nongnu.org/numdiff/)
  - `ndiff` (https://www.math.utah.edu/~beebe/software/ndiff/)

### Using CMake and CTest for Automatic Testing

To automate tests in a CMake environment, the following configuration integrates CTest and ndiff into the workflow.

**CMakeLists.txt Example**
```cmake
enable_testing()
add_test(NAME wave_simulation_test COMMAND ./simulate_wave)
```

### Example of a Test Script Using Ndiff
```bash
#!/bin/sh
./simulate_wave > serial_output.txt
mpirun -n 2 ./simulate_wave > parallel_output.txt
ndiff --relative-error 1.0e-4 serial_output.txt parallel_output.txt
```

### Unit and Regression Tests for Parallel Code
1. **Unit Tests**: Test specific subroutines or functions to catch issues early.
2. **Regression Tests**: Nightly or weekly tests to prevent code degradation.
3. **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automate testing upon each commit with tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI.

## 2.1.3 Addressing Memory Issues in Parallel Code

### Detecting Memory Issues with Valgrind
Valgrindâ€™s Memcheck tool is highly effective for detecting memory leaks and uninitialized variables in parallel applications.

**Example Code to Test with Valgrind**
```c
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int *iarray = (int *) malloc(10 * sizeof(int));
    for (int i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
        iarray[i] = i; // Potential memory overrun
    }
    free(iarray);
    return 0;
}
```
Run the code with Valgrind:
```bash
valgrind --leak-check=full ./test_program
```
### Common Memory Issues in Parallel Programming
- **Uninitialized Memory Access**: Accessing data before it is set.
- **Memory Overwrites**: Writing beyond array boundaries.
## 2.1.4 Enhancing Code Portability
Ensuring code compatibility across multiple compilers (e.g., GCC, Intel, PGI) improves flexibility when targeting different HPC platforms.

### Compiler Flags for Portability
- **GCC**: `-fopenmp` for OpenMP and `-std=c++17` for C++17 features.
- **Intel Compiler**: Use Intel-specific flags to optimize parallel performance.

**Example: Integrating OpenMP in Rust Using Portability Libraries**
```rust
use rayon::prelude::*;

fn parallel_sum(data: &[i32]) -> i32 {
    data.par_iter().sum()
}
```

### Code Cleanup for Parallel Development

**Best Practices for Clean Code in Parallel Projects**:
1. **Modularity**: Isolate computational kernels into well-defined functions.
2. **Memory Management**: Regularly check for leaks using tools like Valgrind.

## 2.2 Incremental Implementation of Parallelization

Parallelism should be implemented in small, iterative steps, validating each step to ensure correctness and performance improvements.

### Implementing Parallelism: An Agile Approach

**Figure 2.3: Agile Parallel Development Cycle**
```
1. Identify Bottleneck
2. Implement Parallelization
3. Test for Performance
4. Validate Results
5. Commit Changes
```

### Rust Code Example: Incremental Parallelization with Rayon
```rust
fn compute_sum(data: &[i32]) -> i32 {
    data.iter().sum()
}

fn parallelize_sum(data: &[i32]) -> i32 {
    data.par_iter().sum()
}
```
### Equations for Speedup Analysis
- **Speedup Equation**: 
  ```
  Speedup = T_serial / T_parallel
  ```
- **Efficiency**:
  ```
  Efficiency = Speedup / Number_of_Processors
  ```
## Best Practices for Parallel Development Workflow
1. **Commit Regularly**: Keep commits small and track incremental changes.
2. **Use Automated Tests**: Integrate CTest for unit and regression tests.
3. **Analyze Bottlenecks**: Profile your application regularly to identify and address performance limitations.

## Summary

### Key Takeaways for Parallel Project Planning

- **Version Control**: Essential for managing changes and ensuring robust development.
- **Testing**: Automate testing with CTest and validate across multiple compilers.
- **Memory Management**: Use tools like Valgrind to ensure memory correctness in parallel applications.
- **Incremental Development**: Implement parallelism in small steps to ensure stability and performance gains.

### Final Thoughts

Parallel computing is a systematic journey that involves careful planning, testing, and incremental implementation. Mastery of these practices ensures that your applications are optimized for high performance on modern multi-core and distributed systems.
