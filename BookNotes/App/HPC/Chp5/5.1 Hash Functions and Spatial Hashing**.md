## **1. Introduction to Hash Functions** <a name="intro-to-hash-functions"></a>

### **What is a Hash Function?**
A **hash function** maps keys to values in a way that ideally minimizes collisions. The goal is to generate a unique hash for each key to ensure efficient data storage and retrieval.

**Example ASCII Equation:**
- Assume the string "ROMERO" with ASCII values:
  - **R = 82**, **O = 79**, **M = 77**, etc.
  - A possible hash computation:
    \[
    \text{Hash Key} = 82 - 64 + 26 + 79 - 4 = 59
    \]

### **Perfect Hashing**
- **Perfect Hash**: A perfect hash has exactly one entry in each bucket with no collisions.
- **Minimal Perfect Hash**: Each bucket contains exactly one entry and no empty buckets.
- **Load Factor**: Defined as \( n/k \), where \( n \) is the number of entries and \( k \) is the number of buckets. A higher load factor indicates a more compact hash.

### **Equation for Load Factor**
\[
\text{Load Factor} = \frac{\text{Number of Entries}}{\text{Number of Buckets}}
\]
- Optimal load factors are typically in the range of **0.8 to 0.9**.

## **2. Spatial Hashing: A Highly-Parallel Algorithm** <a name="spatial-hashing"></a>

### **Overview of Spatial Hashing**
- **Spatial Hashing** is used to map spatial data (like points in a grid) into a hash table for efficient queries.
- Commonly applied in simulations, such as wave propagation or particle collision detection.

#### **Example: Krakatau Wave Simulation**
Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) techniques increase the resolution in regions of interest (like wave fronts) while maintaining a coarser grid elsewhere, using unstructured or semi-structured data representations.

### **Particle Interaction Pseudocode**
```rust
// Pseudocode for Particle Interaction Loop
for particle in particles {
    for neighbor in adjacent_buckets {
        if distance(particle, neighbor) < interaction_distance {
            perform_interaction();
        }
    }
}
```
- **Complexity**: Achieves a complexity of Θ(1) for lookups, making it highly efficient in parallel computing scenarios.

## **3. Perfect Hashing for Spatial Mesh Operations** <a name="perfect-hashing"></a>

### **Neighbor Finding in Spatial Hashing**
- **Goal**: Identify the neighboring cells in a mesh for scientific simulations or image analysis.
- **Algorithm Complexity**: Reduced from O(N²) in naive implementations to O(N) using perfect hashing.

**Perfect Hashing Algorithm Steps**
1. **Allocate** a spatial hash with buckets sized according to the finest cell resolution.
2. **Write** cell indices to the hash table.
3. **Compute** finer cell indices for neighbor queries.
4. **Read** neighbor cell indices from the hash.

#### **Visual Example**
```
Hash Table:
Bucket [21]: Cell 21
Query for right neighbor: Check Bucket [22] -> Cell 22
```

### **Performance Equation for Neighbor Finding**
\[
\text{Time Complexity} = O(N)
\]

## **4. Compact Hashing for Optimized Performance** <a name="compact-hashing"></a>

### **Optimizing Perfect Hashing with Compact Hashing**
- **Compact Hashing** reduces memory requirements by handling collisions efficiently using techniques like open addressing.
- **Collision Handling** Strategies:
  - **Linear Probing**: Sequentially search for the next empty slot.
  - **Quadratic Probing**: Check slots in a non-linear manner to reduce clustering.
  - **Double Hashing**: Use a secondary hash function to find an alternate slot.

#### **Equation for Open Addressing Techniques**
\[
\text{Next Slot} = (\text{Current Index} + i^2) \mod \text{Table Size}
\]

### **Impact on Performance**
Compact hashing can offer substantial speedups in environments with high memory constraints while maintaining efficient query performance.

## **5. Hierarchical Hash Techniques for Remap Operations** <a name="hierarchical-hash"></a>

### **Hierarchical Hash with Breadcrumbs**
- Uses multiple hash levels to trace values back to finer levels using sentinel values.
- **Breadcrumb Approach**: Sentinels indicate finer-level data presence, minimizing unnecessary data access.

#### **Algorithm Visualization**
```
Hash Table Levels:
Level 1: [Sentinel]
Level 2: [Cell Data]
Level 3: [Finer Cell Data]
```

### **Algorithm Complexity**
\[
\text{Time Complexity} = O(\log N) \text{ for hierarchical levels}
\]

## **6. Rust Code Examples** <a name="rust-examples"></a>

### **Rust Implementation: Hash Table Setup for Neighbor Finding**
```rust
fn create_hash_table(cells: &[Cell], max_level: usize) -> HashMap<(usize, usize), usize> {
    let mut hash_table = HashMap::new();
    for cell in cells.iter() {
        let key = (cell.x / 2_usize.pow(max_level as u32), cell.y / 2_usize.pow(max_level as u32));
        hash_table.insert(key, cell.id);
    }
    hash_table
}
```

### **Performance-Oriented Parallel Hashing**
```rust
use rayon::prelude::*;

fn parallel_hashing(cells: &[Cell]) -> HashMap<(usize, usize), usize> {
    cells.par_iter()
        .map(|cell| ((cell.x / 2, cell.y / 2), cell.id))
        .collect()
}
```
- **Benefit**: Efficient parallelization using Rayon for high-performance execution.

## **7. Performance Analysis** <a name="performance-analysis"></a>

### **Comparative Performance Analysis: Perfect vs. Compact Hashing**
- **Perfect Hashing**: Optimized for scenarios with low memory overhead.
- **Compact Hashing**: Suitable for environments with high sparsity, achieving better memory efficiency.

### **Performance Metrics for GPUs**
- **Perfect Hash Speedup**: Achieved a **3,157x** speedup on GPUs.
- **Compact Hash Performance**: Exhibited up to **6x** faster performance compared to traditional methods.

**Equation for Speedup Calculation**
\[
\text{Speedup} = \frac{\text{Execution Time (CPU)}}{\text{Execution Time (GPU)}}
\]
