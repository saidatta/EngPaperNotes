### **Perfect Hashing for Neighbor Finding in Scientific Simulations**
- **Use Case**: Perfect hashing is particularly effective in scenarios where the simulation requires frequent updates of neighboring cell states.
- **Scientific Domains**:
  - **Fluid Dynamics**: Simulating airflow around an object.
  - **Molecular Dynamics**: Tracking interactions between atoms in a molecule.
  - **Finite Element Analysis (FEA)**: Calculating stress distribution on a physical object.

### **Spatial Hashing in Particle Simulations**

- **Application Areas**:
  - **Climate Modeling**: Refining regions of high-pressure changes.
  - **Wave Propagation**: Enhancing resolution at wavefronts.

### **Rust Code Example: Spatial Hash for Particle Simulation**

Here's a Rust example demonstrating the use of spatial hashing for particle collision detection:
```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Particle {
    id: usize,
    position: (f32, f32),
}

fn create_spatial_hash(particles: &[Particle], grid_size: f32) -> HashMap<(i32, i32), Vec<usize>> {
    let mut hash_map: HashMap<(i32, i32), Vec<usize>> = HashMap::new();

    for particle in particles.iter() {
        let grid_x = (particle.position.0 / grid_size) as i32;
        let grid_y = (particle.position.1 / grid_size) as i32;
        let bucket = (grid_x, grid_y);

        hash_map.entry(bucket).or_insert(Vec::new()).push(particle.id);
    }

    hash_map
}

fn main() {
    let particles = vec![
        Particle { id: 1, position: (2.3, 3.1) },
        Particle { id: 2, position: (7.8, 9.4) },
        Particle { id: 3, position: (1.0, 1.5) },
    ];

    let grid_size = 2.0;
    let spatial_hash = create_spatial_hash(&particles, grid_size);
    println!("{:?}", spatial_hash);
}
```
### **Explanation**
- This code creates a **spatial hash table** for a list of particles based on their positions, grouping them into grid cells.
- The complexity of lookup operations remains **Θ(1)**, making it highly efficient for large datasets.

### **Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) Code Example**

This example demonstrates a simple AMR implementation in Rust to refine regions of a computational grid dynamically:
```rust
fn adaptive_mesh_refinement(grid: &mut Vec<Vec<f64>>, threshold: f64) {
    let mut refined_grid = Vec::new();

    for row in grid.iter() {
        let mut refined_row = Vec::new();
        for &cell in row.iter() {
            if cell > threshold {
                // Refine the cell by splitting it into 4 smaller cells
                refined_row.push(cell / 4.0);
                refined_row.push(cell / 4.0);
            } else {
                refined_row.push(cell);
            }
        }
        refined_grid.push(refined_row);
    }

    *grid = refined_grid;
}

fn main() {
    let mut grid = vec![
        vec![0.1, 0.2, 0.3],
        vec![0.4, 0.5, 0.6],
        vec![0.7, 0.8, 0.9],
    ];

    let refinement_threshold = 0.5;
    adaptive_mesh_refinement(&mut grid, refinement_threshold);
    println!("{:?}", grid);
}
```
- **Purpose**: The code dynamically refines the grid by subdividing cells that exceed a threshold value.
- **Usage**: Commonly used in applications requiring high-resolution data in localized regions.

## **9. Hierarchical Hash Techniques for Remap Operations** <a name="hierarchical-hash"></a>

### **Breadcrumb Approach in Hierarchical Hash Tables**
- **Concept**: Each level of the hierarchical hash table contains pointers (breadcrumbs) to finer resolution levels, minimizing unnecessary data retrieval.
- **Advantages**:
  - Reduces memory initialization requirements.
  - Allows for dynamic traversal of data across different levels of refinement.

### **Example: Implementation of Hierarchical Hashing**
Here's a simplified Rust implementation demonstrating the hierarchical hash technique with breadcrumb navigation:
```rust
struct HierarchicalHashTable {
    levels: Vec<HashMap<(i32, i32), i32>>,
}

impl HierarchicalHashTable {
    fn new(level_count: usize) -> Self {
        let mut levels = Vec::with_capacity(level_count);
        for _ in 0..level_count {
            levels.push(HashMap::new());
        }
        Self { levels }
    }

    fn insert(&mut self, level: usize, key: (i32, i32), value: i32) {
        for i in (0..=level).rev() {
            self.levels[i].insert(key, if i == level { value } else { -1 });
        }
    }

    fn query(&self, key: (i32, i32)) -> Option<i32> {
        for level in self.levels.iter() {
            if let Some(&value) = level.get(&key) {
                if value != -1 {
                    return Some(value);
                }
            }
        }
        None
    }
}
```
- **Breadcrumb Trail**: Sentinel values in coarser levels guide the query towards the finer data points.
- **Performance**: This structure efficiently reduces unnecessary memory checks and accelerates the data access process.
