This chapter elaborates on integrating Docker functionalities within the orchestrator to handle tasks like starting and stopping containers, akin to managing specific steps in preparing a dish, using the orchestrator to ensure resources are appropriately allocated and managed.
#### Key Topics Covered
- Docker command line basics for managing containers.
- Utilizing the Docker API for programmatically controlling containers.
- Extending the Task concept to include starting and stopping containers.

#### 3.1 Docker Command Line Interactions
- **Starting Containers**: Use `docker run` with options to set environment variables, port mappings, and container names to start services like PostgreSQL.
  - Example: `docker run -it -p 5432:5432 --name cube-book -e POSTGRES_USER=cube -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret postgres`
- **Inspecting Containers**: `docker inspect` provides detailed information about the container's state, useful for debugging and system monitoring.
  - Example: `docker inspect cube-book`
- **Stopping Containers**: Containers can be halted using `docker stop`, after which their status can be verified with `docker inspect`.
  - Example: `docker stop cube-book`
#### 3.2 Docker API for Container Management
- **API Integration**: Direct interaction with Docker's API using tools like `curl` or through the Docker SDK in Go to fetch container information or manage container lifecycle.
  - Example: `curl --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock http://docker/containers/<container-id>/json | jq .`
- **Docker SDK Usage**: The Docker SDK provides methods for container operations, abstracting away the HTTP requests and simplifying code implementation.
  - Key Methods: `NewClientWithOpts`, `ImagePull`, `ContainerCreate`, `ContainerStart`, `ContainerStop`, `ContainerRemove`
#### 3.3 Implementing the Task Concept
- **Task Configuration**: Structured using the `Config` struct in Go, encapsulating details like image name, CPU/memory requirements, environmental variables, and restart policies.
  - Code Implementation: Definition of the `Config` struct with Docker-specific fields for task management.
- **Starting and Stopping Tasks**:
  - **Starting**: Incorporating Docker SDK methods to pull images, create, and start containers based on task configurations.
  - **Stopping**: Simplified process using the Docker SDK to stop and remove containers efficiently.
  - Code Examples: Illustration of using Docker SDK to handle the start and stop operations programmatically.
#### 3.4 Practical Application and Code Testing
- **Test Implementations**: Code snippets demonstrate the initialization of the Docker client, configuration setup, and execution of start/stop operations through structured functions and methods.
- **System Verification**: Running test programs to validate the integration and functionality of the task management with Docker, ensuring tasks are correctly executed and managed.
#### Summary
Chapter 3 progresses the development of the orchestrator by integrating Docker to manage tasks effectively. It highlights the practical use of Docker command-line tools and API calls within the orchestrator framework to handle containers as tasks. This includes detailed explanations of the commands and code required to start, inspect, and stop containers, making the orchestrator capable of managing resources similar to managing steps in cooking a meal. The Docker SDK's role is emphasized as a tool that simplifies interactions with Docker, allowing the orchestrator to focus on core functionalities rather than low-level details. This chapter sets the foundation for more complex task management and resource allocation strategies that will be built upon in subsequent chapters.
