## ETL Model

### Overview

- **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** is the traditional process of moving data from source systems to target systems, involving extraction, transformation, and loading.
- **ETL Complexity**: As systems scale and data volumes increase, ETL processes become more complex and resource-intensive.
- **Balancing Complexity and Scalability**: Modern approaches aim to reduce ETL complexity while maintaining scalability and flexibility.

## Zero-ETL

### Definition

Zero-ETL is an approach aiming to **eliminate or minimize** the need for traditional ETL processes. It focuses on:

- **Real-Time Data Integration**: Enabling real-time or near-real-time data availability.
- **Schema-on-Read**: Interpreting data schema during analysis rather than during transformation.
- **Data Virtualization**: Providing unified views of data without physical movement.
- **In-Database Processing**: Performing transformations within the database systems.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Immediate updates triggered by data changes.
- **Modern Data Architectures**: Utilizing data lakes and cloud solutions for scalability.

### AWS Zero-ETL Architecture

![AWS Zero-ETL Architecture](aws_zero_etl.png)

*Figure 8-2: AWS's Zero-ETL Architecture for Amazon Aurora and Redshift*

- **Components**:
  - **Amazon Aurora**: OLTP database.
  - **Amazon Redshift**: Data warehouse (OLAP database).
- **Integration**:
  - **Managed Integration**: Tight coupling allows near-real-time data availability in Redshift after it's written to Aurora.
  - **No Transformation in Transit**: Data is not transformed between Aurora and Redshift; transformations occur in Redshift.

### Challenges and Considerations

- **Vendor Lock-In**: Solutions like AWS Zero-ETL are specific to their cloud ecosystem.
- **Lack of Transformations**: Without transformations during data movement, batch processing or slow queries may occur.
- **Not Universally Applicable**: May not suit organizations with complex data integration or regulatory requirements.

**Key Aspects of Zero-ETL**:

## Near-Zero-ETL

### Definition

Near-Zero-ETL aims to **limit ETL infrastructure** while retaining flexibility for complex data integration. It involves:

- Using data systems with **embedded features** for data movement.
- Avoiding self-managed connectors and separate infrastructure.
- Balancing between Zero-ETL simplicity and traditional ETL flexibility.

### Implementation Strategies

1. **Leveraging OLTP Databases with Embedded Features**:
   - Databases emit data directly to other systems or streaming platforms.
   - Reduces the need for external connectors and infrastructure.

2. **Utilizing Stream Processing for Transformations**:
   - Incorporate stream processing to handle data transformations in real-time.
   - Allows for the creation of materialized views and differentiation between push and pull queries.

### Example Architecture

![Near-Zero-ETL Architecture](near_zero_etl.png)

*Figure 8-3: Near-Zero-ETL using PeerDB and Timeplus/Proton*

- **Components**:
  - **PeerDB**: Enables PostgreSQL to send a stream of data to a streaming platform.
  - **Timeplus/Proton**: Provides transformations at ingestion and serves as a streaming OLAP database.

- **Flow**:
  1. Data changes in PostgreSQL are captured and sent via PeerDB.
  2. Timeplus/Proton ingests the data stream, applies transformations, and provides materialized views.
  3. Real-time analytics are served with minimal latency.

## PeerDB

### Introduction

- **PeerDB** is an open-source solution to stream data from PostgreSQL to data warehouses, queues/topics, and other storage engines.
- **Goal**: Simplify ETL by providing a **database experience** when integrating with analytical systems.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Peers**: Connections to databases that PeerDB can query.
  - **Mirrors**: Asynchronous data copies from source peers to target peers.

### Creating Peers

**Example: Setting Up a Peer to Another PostgreSQL Database**

```sql
CREATE PEER source FROM POSTGRES WITH
(
  host = 'catalog',
  port = '5432',
  user = 'postgres',
  password = 'postgres',
  database = 'source'
);
```

**Example: Setting Up a Peer to a Snowflake Data Warehouse**

```sql
CREATE PEER sf_peer FROM SNOWFLAKE WITH
(
  account_id = '<snowflake_account_identifier>',
  username = '<user_name>',
  private_key = '<private_key>',
  password = '<password>', -- only if the private key is encrypted
  database = '<database_name>',
  schema = '<schema>',
  warehouse = '<warehouse>',
  role = '<role>',
  query_timeout = '<query_timeout_in_seconds>'
);
```

**Querying Data from a Peer**

```sql
SELECT * FROM sf_peer.MY_SCHEMA.MY_TABLE;
```

- **Explanation**:
  - **Peers** act as connections to other databases.
  - You can perform `SELECT` queries on tables from peers as if they were local.

### Mirroring Data

**Creating an ETL with a PeerDB MIRROR**

```sql
CREATE MIRROR <mirror_name> [IF NOT EXISTS] FROM
  <source_peer> TO <target_peer> FOR
$$
  SELECT * FROM <source_table_name> WHERE
  <watermark_column> BETWEEN {{.start}} AND {{.end}}
$$
WITH (
  destination_table_name = '<schema_qualified_destination_table_name>',
  watermark_column = '<watermark_column>',
  watermark_table_name = '<table_on_source_on_which_watermark_filter_should_be_applied>',
  mode = '<mode>',
  unique_key_columns = '<unique_key_columns>',
  parallelism = <parallelism>,
  refresh_interval = <refresh_interval_in_seconds>,
  sync_data_format = '<sync_data_format>',
  num_rows_per_partition = 100000,
  initial_copy_only = <true|false>,
  setup_watermark_table_on_destination = <true|false>
);
```

- **Explanation**:
  - **Mirrors** asynchronously copy data from a source peer to a target peer.
  - The `SELECT` statement defines the data to mirror.
  - Various parameters control the mirroring behavior.

### Limitations and Considerations

- **No Transformations in Mirrors**:
  - Mirrors do not support transformations during data transfer.
  - Transformations must occur **before** or **after** mirroring.

- **Impact on OLTP Databases**:
  - Performing transformations before mirroring can tax OLTP databases.
  - OLTP databases are optimized for transactional workloads, not heavy transformations.

- **Batch Processing Semantics**:
  - Without real-time transformations, data processing may revert to batch semantics, introducing latency.

- **Size Limitations**:
  - PostgreSQL may not handle large volumes of data efficiently.
  - Analytical data may need to be reduced to fit within OLTP capacity.

## Mathematical Concepts

### Data Flow and Latency Considerations

- **Latency (\( L \))**:
  - Total latency is the sum of latencies at each stage.
  - \( L_{\text{total}} = L_{\text{extraction}} + L_{\text{transformation}} + L_{\text{loading}} \)

- **Throughput (\( T \))**:
  - Number of records processed per unit time.
  - \( T = \frac{N}{L_{\text{total}}} \), where \( N \) is the number of records.

- **Trade-Offs**:
  - **Zero-ETL** minimizes \( L_{\text{extraction}} \) and \( L_{\text{loading}} \) but may increase \( L_{\text{transformation}} \) if transformations are deferred.
  - **Near-Zero-ETL** aims to balance latencies by integrating transformations efficiently.

### Resource Utilization

- **CPU and Memory Usage (\( U_{\text{CPU}}, U_{\text{Memory}} \))**:
  - High resource utilization when performing heavy transformations in OLTP databases.
  - Optimal utilization requires offloading transformations to appropriate systems.

- **Scalability**:
  - OLTP databases have limited scalability for analytical workloads.
  - Distributed systems can handle larger workloads but introduce complexity.

---

## Summary

- **Zero-ETL** and **Near-Zero-ETL** are paradigms aiming to reduce ETL complexity and latency.
- **Zero-ETL** minimizes data movement and transformations but may lack flexibility.
- **Near-Zero-ETL** offers a balanced approach, using systems like **PeerDB** to provide flexibility without extensive infrastructure.
- **PeerDB** enables data streaming from PostgreSQL to other systems, simplifying data integration.
- **Limitations** include the inability to perform transformations during mirroring and the resource constraints of OLTP databases.
- **Mathematical considerations** highlight the trade-offs between latency, throughput, and resource utilization.
