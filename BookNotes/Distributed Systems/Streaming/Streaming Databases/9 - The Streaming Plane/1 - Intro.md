## Overview

In this chapter, we delve into the concept of the **Streaming Plane**, which serves as a bridge between the **Operational Plane** (OLTP systems) and the **Analytical Plane** (OLAP systems). Unlike the other two planes that deal primarily with data at rest, the streaming plane is characterized by **data in motion**. We'll explore how data architects and engineers can leverage the streaming plane to simplify real-time analytics, mitigate data gravity issues, and decentralize data processing.

## Introduction

In the previous chapter, we introduced three distinct data planes:

1. **Operational Plane**: Focuses on transactional workloads (OLTP), dealing with data at rest.
2. **Analytical Plane**: Handles analytical workloads (OLAP), also dealing with data at rest.
3. **Streaming Plane**: Unique in that it deals with **data in motion**, enabling real-time data processing and analytics.

We have used terms like **asynchronous**, **data in motion**, and **streaming** interchangeably to describe long-running processes that continuously transform data, making real-time analytical data retrieval for applications faster and simpler.

## Data Gravity

### Concept and Analogy

**Data Gravity** is a metaphor that likens data to a planet with mass, which exerts a gravitational pull on services and applications. As data accumulates, its "mass" increases, attracting more applications and services, much like gravity attracts objects in space.

- **Analogy**: Just as the Earthâ€™s gravity keeps the Moon in orbit and prevents us from drifting into space, data's gravity pulls in more services and applications.
- **Example**: Posting a message on social media generates data that attracts interactions (likes, comments), creating more data.

### Impact on Data Architectures

In traditional data architectures without the streaming plane:

- **One-Way Data Flow**: Data moves from the operational plane to the analytical plane.
- **Centralization**: The analytical plane becomes a monolithic system, accumulating vast amounts of historical data.
- **Latency Issues**: As data size increases, workloads suffer from increased latency due to data gravity.

- **Operational Plane Moons**: Represent systems pushing data to the analytical plane.
- **Analytical Plane Planet**: Becomes increasingly massive, pulling in more data and applications.

## Components of the Streaming Plane

The streaming plane introduces fluidity, allowing data to move more freely and reducing the effects of data gravity.

![Streaming Plane Components](streaming_plane_components.png)

*Figure 9-4: The Streaming Plane.*

### Key Components:

1. **Streaming Platforms**:
   - **Example**: Apache Kafka.
   - **Function**: Acts as the backbone for data streams, enabling high-throughput, low-latency data pipelines.

2. **Source and Sink Connectors**:
   - **Source Connectors**: Pull data from external systems into the streaming platform.
   - **Sink Connectors**: Push data from the streaming platform to external systems.

3. **Stream Processors**:
   - **Examples**: Apache Flink, Apache Spark Streaming.
   - **Function**: Perform real-time data transformations, aggregations, and enrichments.

4. **RTOLAP Databases** (Real-Time Online Analytical Processing):
   - **Examples**: Apache Druid, Apache Pinot.
   - **Function**: Provide real-time analytical capabilities with low-latency queries.

5. **Streaming Databases**:
   - **Examples**: Materialize, RisingWave.
   - **Function**: Combine stream processing with database features, allowing for SQL queries over streaming data.

### Data Flow in the Streaming Plane

- **Data Ingestion**: Data from the operational plane is ingested into the streaming platform via source connectors.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Stream processors and streaming databases consume data from the streaming platform, perform transformations, and create materialized views.
- **Data Consumption**: Transformed data can be consumed by applications in the operational plane or stored in RTOLAP databases for analytical queries.

## Streaming Plane Infrastructure

### Reasons for Dedicated Infrastructure

Architects should consider **dedicating infrastructure** to the streaming plane for several reasons:

1. **Scalability**:
   - **Need**: Handle increased data loads without performance degradation.
   - **Approach**: Scale components horizontally (adding more nodes) or vertically (adding resources to existing nodes).

2. **Performance**:
   - **Optimization**: Tailor infrastructure to meet the demands of high-throughput, low-latency data processing.
   - **Isolation**: Prevent resource contention with operational and analytical workloads.

3. **Reliability and Availability**:
   - **Redundancy**: Implement failover mechanisms and data replication to ensure continuous operation.
   - **Fault Tolerance**: Design for resilience against node failures.

4. **Security**:
   - **Access Controls**: Enforce strict permissions and authentication mechanisms.
   - **Data Protection**: Implement encryption in transit and at rest where applicable.

5. **Integration**:
   - **Flexibility**: Facilitate seamless integration with various data sources and sinks.
   - **Decoupling**: Allow independent evolution of operational and analytical systems.

6. **Cost Efficiency**:
   - **Resource Allocation**: Optimize costs by allocating resources specifically for streaming workloads.
   - **Elasticity**: Scale resources up or down based on demand.

### Ephemeral Data and Fluidity

- **Ephemeral Data**: Data in the streaming plane is typically short-lived, processed in real-time, and not stored long-term.
- **Fluidity**: The streaming plane allows data to flow back into the operational plane, enabling real-time analytics and reducing data gravity effects.

## Mathematical Concepts

### Data Movement and Latency

**Latency (\( L \))** in data processing is crucial, especially in real-time analytics.

- **Total Latency (\( L_{\text{total}} \))**:
  \[
  L_{\text{total}} = L_{\text{ingest}} + L_{\text{process}} + L_{\text{deliver}}
  \]
  Where:
  - \( L_{\text{ingest}} \): Latency in data ingestion.
  - \( L_{\text{process}} \): Latency in data processing/transformation.
  - \( L_{\text{deliver}} \): Latency in delivering processed data to consumers.

- **Goal**: Minimize \( L_{\text{total}} \) to enable real-time analytics.

### Data Gravity Formula

While data gravity is a metaphor, we can conceptualize its impact mathematically.

- **Data Gravity (\( G \))**: Represents the "pull" that data exerts on applications and services.
- **Factors Influencing \( G \)**:
  - **Data Mass (\( M \))**: Volume of data.
  - **Interaction Frequency (\( F \))**: How often data is accessed or modified.
  - **Network Latency (\( N \))**: Latency in data transfer.

- **Data Gravity Equation** (conceptual):
  \[
  G = k \times \frac{M \times F}{N}
  \]
  Where:
  - \( k \): Proportionality constant.
  - Higher \( M \) and \( F \) increase \( G \), while higher \( N \) decreases \( G \).

- **Implication**: As data mass and interaction frequency increase, the gravitational pull on applications grows, leading to centralized architectures and latency issues.

## Code Examples

### Implementing a Stream Processor with Flink

Let's illustrate how to implement a simple Flink job to process streaming data from Kafka.

**Prerequisites**:

- Apache Kafka cluster running.
- Apache Flink set up.

**1. Define Kafka Source in Flink**

```sql
CREATE TABLE kafka_source (
  user_id STRING,
  action STRING,
  timestamp TIMESTAMP(3),
  WATERMARK FOR timestamp AS timestamp - INTERVAL '5' SECOND
) WITH (
  'connector' = 'kafka',
  'topic' = 'user_actions',
  'properties.bootstrap.servers' = 'localhost:9092',
  'format' = 'json',
  'json.timestamp-format.standard' = 'ISO-8601'
);
```

**2. Define Transformation Logic**

```sql
CREATE VIEW user_action_counts AS
SELECT
  TUMBLE_START(timestamp, INTERVAL '1' MINUTE) AS window_start,
  TUMBLE_END(timestamp, INTERVAL '1' MINUTE) AS window_end,
  action,
  COUNT(*) AS action_count
FROM kafka_source
GROUP BY
  TUMBLE(timestamp, INTERVAL '1' MINUTE),
  action;
```

**3. Define Kafka Sink**

```sql
CREATE TABLE kafka_sink (
  window_start TIMESTAMP(3),
  window_end TIMESTAMP(3),
  action STRING,
  action_count BIGINT
) WITH (
  'connector' = 'kafka',
  'topic' = 'action_counts',
  'properties.bootstrap.servers' = 'localhost:9092',
  'format' = 'json',
  'json.timestamp-format.standard' = 'ISO-8601'
);
```

**4. Insert into Kafka Sink**

```sql
INSERT INTO kafka_sink
SELECT
  window_start,
  window_end,
  action,
  action_count
FROM user_action_counts;
```

**Explanation**:

- **Source Table**: Reads streaming data from the `user_actions` Kafka topic.
- **Transformation**: Aggregates actions over 1-minute tumbling windows.
- **Sink Table**: Writes aggregated results to the `action_counts` Kafka topic.

---

## Summary

- The **Streaming Plane** plays a crucial role in modern data architectures by enabling real-time data processing and analytics.
- **Data Gravity** can lead to centralized, monolithic analytical systems with increased latency.
- Introducing the streaming plane allows for **data decentralization**, reducing latency and mitigating data gravity effects.
- **Components** like streaming platforms, connectors, stream processors, RTOLAP databases, and streaming databases form the backbone of the streaming plane.
