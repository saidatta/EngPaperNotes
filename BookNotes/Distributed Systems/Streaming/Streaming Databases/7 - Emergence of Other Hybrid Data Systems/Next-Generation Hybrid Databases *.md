## Overview

As the demand for real-time analytics grows, there's a clear trend toward databases that seamlessly integrate features from **Operational (OLTP)**, **Analytical (OLAP)**, and **Streaming** data planes. These **next-generation hybrid databases** aim to reduce infrastructure complexity, improve latency, and provide greater accessibility to engineers.

   - Supports complex event processing and materialized views.

2. **Columnar Storage for Analytical Workloads**:
   - Efficient storage format for analytical queries.
   - Optimizes read performance for large datasets.

3. **Consistency for Operational Workloads**:
   - Ensures ACID properties for transactional integrity.
   - Provides immediate consistency required by operational applications.

## Existing Hybrid Databases and Their Paths to Next-Generation Status

### 1. Streaming OLTP Databases

**Current State**:
- Provide consistency and integrate stream processing with OLTP workloads.
- Examples: **RisingWave**, **Materialize**.

**Path to Next-Generation**:
- **Incorporate Columnar Storage**:
  - Embed an OLAP database like **DuckDB** for analytical queries.
  - **Example Integration**:

    ```sql
    -- Create a table in DuckDB embedded within an OLTP database
    CREATE TABLE analytics_data AS
    SELECT * FROM operational_data
    WHERE timestamp >= DATE_SUB('day', 30, CURRENT_DATE);
    ```

- **Enhance Data Consistency Models**:
  - Implement stronger consistency guarantees in stream processing.
  - **Mathematical Concept**:
    - Use **Snapshot Isolation** to ensure transactions read from a consistent snapshot of the database.
    - **Formula**:
      \[
      \text{Consistency Level} = \lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\text{Data Staleness}}{t} = 0
      \]

- **Emit CDC Data Directly to Streaming Platforms**:
  - Integrate native CDC (Change Data Capture) mechanisms.
  - **Diagram**:

    ![Emitting CDC Data to Kafka](cdc_to_kafka.png)

    *Figure: Streaming OLTP databases pushing CDC data directly into a Kafka-compliant topic.*

  - **Code Example** (Pseudocode):

    ```python
    # Pseudocode for emitting CDC data directly to Kafka
    def emit_cdc_to_kafka(transaction):
        kafka_producer.send('cdc_topic', serialize(transaction))
    ```

### 2. Streaming OLAP Databases

**Current State**:
- Focus on analytical workloads with streaming ingestion.
- Example: **Proton**.

**Path to Next-Generation**:
- **Add Consistency to Stream Processing**:
  - Implement synchronization mechanisms to ensure consistent results.
  - **Mathematical Explanation**:
    - Use **Barriers** or **Watermarks** to synchronize data streams.
    - **Formula**:
      \[
      \text{Consistency} = \frac{\text{Synchronized Data}}{\text{Total Data}}
      \]

- **Incorporate Stateful Stream Processing**:
  - Support stateful operations like joins and aggregations over time windows.
  - **Code Example**:

    ```sql
    -- Define a stateful windowed aggregation
    SELECT
      user_id,
      COUNT(*) AS activity_count
    FROM
      user_activity
    GROUP BY
      user_id,
      TUMBLE(event_time, INTERVAL '1' DAY);
    ```

### 3. HTAP Databases

**Current State**:
- Handle both OLTP and OLAP workloads.
- Examples: **SingleStoreDB**, **TiDB**, **HydraDB**.

**Path to Next-Generation**:
- **Implement Incremental View Maintenance (IVM)**:
  - Asynchronously update materialized views with only the changes.
  - **Mathematical Concept**:
    - Let \( V \) be the materialized view, \( \Delta V \) the change.
    - Update view: \( V_{new} = V_{old} + \Delta V \)
  - **Code Example**:

    ```sql
    -- Define a materialized view with IVM
    CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW sales_summary AS
    SELECT
      product_id,
      SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
    FROM
      sales
    GROUP BY
      product_id
    WITH (incremental = true);
    ```

- **Ingress Limited Historical Data from Analytical Plane**:
  - Pull in subsets of historical data for richer context.
  - **Approach**:
    - Use data virtualization or federated queries.
    - **Example**:

      ```sql
      -- Federated query to access historical data
      SELECT
        o.order_id,
        o.order_date,
        h.customer_history
      FROM
        orders o
      JOIN
        historical_data.h_customer h ON o.customer_id = h.customer_id;
      ```

---

## Detailed Explanations

### Incremental View Maintenance (IVM)

- **Definition**: A method to maintain materialized views by applying only the incremental changes, rather than recomputing the entire view.
- **Benefits**:
  - Reduces computation overhead.
  - Provides near real-time updates to materialized views.

- **Mathematical Representation**:

  Let:
  - \( V \) be the materialized view.
  - \( T \) be the base table.
  - \( \Delta T \) be the change in the base table.
  - \( f \) be the view definition function.

  Then:
  \[
  \Delta V = f(T + \Delta T) - f(T)
  \]
  \[
  V_{\text{new}} = V_{\text{old}} + \Delta V
  \]

- **Example**:

  Suppose we have a table `sales` and a materialized view `total_sales`:

  ```sql
  -- Base table
  CREATE TABLE sales (
    sale_id INT,
    product_id INT,
    quantity INT,
    sale_date DATE
  );

  -- Materialized view
  CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW total_sales AS
  SELECT
    product_id,
    SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
  FROM
    sales
  GROUP BY
    product_id;
  ```

  When new sales are inserted:

  ```sql
  INSERT INTO sales (sale_id, product_id, quantity, sale_date)
  VALUES (101, 1, 5, '2023-11-04');
  ```

  **IVM Process**:
  - Calculate \( \Delta V \) based on the inserted rows.
  - Update `total_sales` incrementally.

### Emitting CDC Data Directly to Kafka

- **Current Challenge**:
  - Using external CDC connectors increases complexity.
  - Issues like out-of-memory exceptions can occur.

- **Solution**:
  - Databases natively emit CDC events to streaming platforms.
  - **Advantages**:
    - Simplifies architecture.
    - Improves reliability.

- **Implementation Example**:

  ```sql
  -- Enable CDC on a table
  ALTER TABLE orders
  ENABLE CHANGE DATA CAPTURE;

  -- Configure CDC to emit to Kafka
  CREATE PUBLICATION orders_pub FOR TABLE orders WITH (FORMAT 'Kafka', TOPIC 'orders_cdc');
  ```

  **Kafka Consumer Code** (Python example):

  ```python
  from kafka import KafkaConsumer
  import json

  consumer = KafkaConsumer(
      'orders_cdc',
      bootstrap_servers=['localhost:9092'],
      value_deserializer=lambda m: json.loads(m.decode('utf-8'))
  )

  for message in consumer:
      cdc_event = message.value
      process_cdc_event(cdc_event)
  ```

## Potential Challenges and Considerations

- **Data Consistency**:
  - Balancing consistency with performance is crucial.
  - Implementing snapshot isolation can help but may add overhead.

- **Storage Overhead**:
  - Incorporating columnar storage increases storage complexity.
  - Need efficient data management strategies.

- **Integration Complexity**:
  - Merging different data plane features requires careful architectural planning.
  - Ensuring compatibility and seamless operation is essential.

---

## Mathematical Concepts

### Snapshot Isolation

- **Definition**: A concurrency control method that ensures transactions read from a consistent snapshot of the database.
- **Prevents**:
  - Dirty reads.
  - Non-repeatable reads.

- **Implementation**:
  - Each transaction operates on a snapshot taken at the start time.
  - **Versioning**: Use of timestamps or version numbers.

- **Formula**:

  Let:
  - \( T_i \) be transaction \( i \) starting at time \( s_i \).
  - \( V(s_i) \) be the snapshot at time \( s_i \).

  Then:
  - Transaction \( T_i \) reads from \( V(s_i) \).

### Data Synchronization Ratio

- **Formula**:
  \[
  \text{Synchronization Ratio} = \frac{\text{Number of Synchronized Operations}}{\text{Total Number of Operations}}
  \]

- **Interpretation**:
  - A higher ratio indicates better consistency.
  - Helps in measuring the effectiveness of synchronization mechanisms.
