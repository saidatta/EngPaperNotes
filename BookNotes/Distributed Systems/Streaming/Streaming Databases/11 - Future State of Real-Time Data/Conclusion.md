### The Convergence of Data Planes and Its Implications

In this journey through the evolving landscape of data processing, we've witnessed the **accelerated convergence of streaming technologies and databases**. This convergence is dissolving the traditional boundaries between the **operational**, **analytical**, and **streaming** data planes, leading to more unified and efficient data architectures.

- **Operational and Streaming Planes**:
  - **Graph Databases** (e.g., Memgraph, thatDot/Quine) are integrating streaming capabilities.
  - **Vector Databases** (e.g., Milvus, Weaviate) are adopting streaming architectures internally.
  - **Incremental View Maintenance (IVM)** tools (e.g., pg_ivm, Epsio) are enabling real-time updates.

- **Analytical and Streaming Planes**:
  - **Data Warehouses** like **BigQuery**, **Redshift**, and **Snowflake** are incorporating streaming ingestion and processing.
  - **Lakehouse Architectures** are being enhanced with streaming capabilities through open table formats like **Apache Iceberg**, **Delta Lake**, and **Apache Hudi**.

### Bringing Database Technologies "Outside In"

The historical evolution from monolithic databases to decomposed systems taught us scalability and flexibility. Now, by bringing these technologies back into a cohesive framework—**"bringing database technologies outside in"**—we are consolidating infrastructure and simplifying interfaces without sacrificing scalability.

### The Rise of Streaming Databases

**Streaming Databases** are at the forefront of this convergence, offering:

- **Real-Time Data Processing**: Continuous ingestion and processing of streaming data.
- **Materialized Views**: Up-to-date views that reflect the latest data changes.
- **Unified Query Interface**: Ability to query both streaming and static data using familiar SQL syntax.

### Mathematical Considerations

#### Streaming Data Processing Models

**Latency (\( L \))** is a critical metric in streaming systems, representing the time delay between data ingestion and availability for querying.

- **Streaming Systems**:

  \[
  L_{\text{stream}} = T_{\text{ingest}} + T_{\text{process}}
  \]

- **Batch Systems**:

  \[
  L_{\text{batch}} = T_{\text{ingest}} + T_{\text{batch\_window}} + T_{\text{process}} + T_{\text{refresh}}
  \]

**Interpretation**:

- **Streaming Systems** have significantly lower latency due to the absence of batch windows and continuous processing.
- **Batch Systems** introduce latency through batch windows and periodic processing.

#### Cost Efficiency

Streaming-native systems can offer **cost savings** over batch-oriented architectures:

- **Resource Utilization**: Continuous processing can lead to better resource utilization.
- **Scalability**: Systems like **Apache Flink** and **Kafka Streams** scale horizontally to handle large data volumes efficiently.

### Code Example: Streaming Query in a Unified Data Plane

Imagine a scenario where we need to perform a **real-time aggregation** of user activities stored in a **streaming platform** (e.g., Kafka) and enrich it with static data from a **lakehouse** (e.g., Iceberg table).

#### Step 1: Define the Streaming Source (Kafka)

```sql
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE user_activities (
    user_id INT,
    activity STRING,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP(3),
    WATERMARK FOR timestamp AS timestamp - INTERVAL '5' SECOND
) WITH (
    'connector' = 'kafka',
    'topic' = 'user_activities',
    'properties.bootstrap.servers' = 'localhost:9092',
    'format' = 'json'
);
```

#### Step 2: Define the Static Data Source (Iceberg Table)

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_profiles (
    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name STRING,
    country STRING
) WITH (
    'connector' = 'iceberg',
    'catalog-name' = 'my_catalog',
    'warehouse' = 's3://my-bucket/warehouse'
);
```

#### Step 3: Perform a Real-Time Join and Aggregation

```sql
SELECT
    TUMBLE_START(timestamp, INTERVAL '1' HOUR) AS window_start,
    up.country,
    COUNT(*) AS activity_count
FROM
    user_activities ua
JOIN
    user_profiles up
ON
    ua.user_id = up.user_id
GROUP BY
    up.country,
    TUMBLE(timestamp, INTERVAL '1' HOUR);
```

- **Explanation**:
  - **Tumbling Window**: Aggregates data in 1-hour windows.
  - **Join**: Enriches streaming data with static user profiles.
  - **Aggregation**: Counts activities per country per window.

### Future Outlook

As we stand at the cusp of this convergence:

- **Streaming Platforms as Single Source of Truth**: With streaming platforms adopting open table formats, they may become the primary storage layer, reducing reliance on separate lakehouses.
- **Unified Data Access**: Technologies like **Confluent's Tableflow** offer both streaming and batch interfaces to the same data.
- **Rise of Stream Processing Solutions**: Purely streaming-based processing may see increased adoption due to performance and cost benefits.
