#### Overview
Streaming data processing is increasingly vital in the realm of big data, driven by the need for timely insights, handling massive unbounded datasets, and evenly spreading workloads. This chapter lays the foundational knowledge, covering terminology, system capabilities, and time domains, setting the stage for a deep dive into the intricacies of streaming systems.
#### Terminology
- **Streaming System**: A data processing engine designed for infinite datasets, addressing the need for real-time data processing and capable of producing correct, consistent, and repeatable results, unlike the traditional, more limited view of streaming for approximate results.
- **Bounded vs. Unbounded Data**:
  - **Bounded Data**: Finite datasets.
  - **Unbounded Data**: Infinite datasets, posing unique challenges for processing frameworks due to their never-ending nature.
- **Table vs. Stream**:
  - **Table**: A snapshot of data at a specific point in time, typically dealt with in SQL systems.
  - **Stream**: The continuous evolution of data over time, traditionally handled by MapReduce and similar data processing systems.
#### Capabilities of Streaming Systems
- Streaming systems are not just for low-latency, inaccurate results. With the right design, they can offer a superset of functionalities provided by batch processing systems.
- The Lambda Architecture, combining batch and streaming to compensate for each other's shortcomings, is no longer necessary with the advancement of streaming systems.
- **Efficiency**: The difference in efficiency between batch and streaming is not inherent but a result of design choices. Modern streaming systems like Apache Flink and Google Cloud Dataflow are examples where streaming is optimized to match or exceed batch processing efficiency.
#### Time Domains: Event Time vs. Processing Time
- **Event Time**: The actual time when an event occurred.
- **Processing Time**: The time when an event is observed by the system.
- Understanding the difference and the relationship between event time and processing time is crucial for correctly processing unbounded data.
#### Challenges and Solutions in Streaming
- **Correctness**: Achieving exactly-once processing through strong consistency is vital. Systems need mechanisms for checkpointing persistent state over time.
- **Time Reasoning Tools**: Essential for handling unbounded, unordered data with variable event-time skew. This includes sophisticated windowing techniques and the ability to manage event-time completeness and processing-time delays.
#### Common Data Processing Patterns
- Detailed examination of processing patterns such as windowing by event time versus processing time, handling lateness, and dealing with stateful computations in streaming scenarios.
#### Example: Basic Streaming Code

```python
# Example Python code using Apache Beam for a simple streaming pipeline

from apache_beam.options.pipeline_options import PipelineOptions
from apache_beam import Pipeline

options = PipelineOptions([
    '--streaming'
])

with Pipeline(options=options) as p:
    (p
     | 'Read From Pub/Sub' >> beam.io.ReadFromPubSub(subscription='your_subscription_here')
     | 'Window into Fixed Intervals' >> beam.WindowInto(beam.window.FixedWindows(60))
     | 'Process Events' >> beam.ParDo(ProcessEventsFn())
     | 'Write To Sink' >> beam.io.WriteToBigQuery(table='your_table_here'))
```
This code snippet demonstrates a basic streaming pipeline using Apache Beam, showcasing how to read from a Pub/Sub subscription, window the data into fixed intervals, process the events, and write the results to BigQuery.

### Data Processing Patterns

#### Introduction
This section delves into the common patterns for processing both bounded and unbounded data, applicable across batch and streaming (including microbatch) engines. Understanding these patterns is crucial for effectively designing and implementing data processing pipelines.

#### Bounded Data Processing
- **Concept**: Processing a finite dataset, transforming it from a state of entropy into a more structured form with added value.
- **Common Engines**: Typically batch engines like MapReduce, although well-designed streaming engines are also capable.
- **Pattern Overview**: The process is straightforward, involving the transformation of unstructured data into structured data through various computations.

#### Unbounded Data Processing
##### Batch Approach
- **Fixed Windows**: The most straightforward method for batch processing unbounded data, involving segmenting the data into fixed-size windows for separate processing. Issues arise with data completeness due to potential delays or distributed data collection challenges.
- **Sessions**: More complex than fixed windows, sessions aim to group periods of activity separated by inactivity. Batch processing faces challenges with session continuity across batches, often requiring additional logic to stitch sessions together.
##### Streaming Approach
- Designed inherently for unbounded data, streaming systems handle unordered data with variable event-time skew efficiently.
- Streaming systems categorize approaches into four groups: time-agnostic, approximation algorithms, windowing by processing time, and windowing by event time.
#### Time-Agnostic Processing
- **Use Cases**: When the temporal aspect of data is irrelevant, focusing solely on data-driven logic.
- **Examples**:
  - **Filtering**: Removing irrelevant data based on specific criteria, unaffected by data's unbounded or unordered nature.
  - **Inner Joins**: Combining two data sources based on matching elements, with no temporal constraints involved.
#### Approximation Algorithms
- **Description**: Providing approximate solutions for data processing, useful for scenarios where exact answers are not feasible or necessary.
- **Characteristics**: Designed for low overhead and suitability for unbounded datasets, but limited by the complexity and the nature of approximations.
#### Windowing
- **Fixed Windows**: Segments time into uniform, fixed-size intervals. Aligned windows apply uniformly across data, while unaligned windows do not.
- **Sliding Windows**: A generalization of fixed windows, defined by a fixed length and period, allowing for overlapping or sampling windows.
- **Sessions**: Dynamic windows defined by activity periods, terminated by inactivity, commonly used for analyzing temporal patterns in user behavior.
#### Windowing by Processing Time
- **Concept**: Grouping data based on their arrival time, simplifying implementation and window completeness judgments.
- **Drawbacks**: Fails to accurately represent event times, especially in scenarios with significant event-time skew.
#### Windowing by Event Time
- **Concept**: Essential for processing data in chunks that accurately reflect when events actually occurred, supporting dynamically sized windows like sessions.
- **Challenges**:
  - **Buffering**: Requires extended window lifetimes, necessitating more data buffering.
  - **Completeness**: Difficulty in determining when all data for a given window have been observed, often relying on heuristic estimates like watermarks.
#### Conclusion
Understanding and effectively applying these data processing patterns are fundamental for building robust, efficient data processing pipelines. Whether dealing with bounded or unbounded datasets, the choice of processing pattern impacts the accuracy, efficiency, and completeness of the processed data, underlining the importance of selecting the right approach for each specific use case.
#### Example: Streaming Session Window Code

```python
# Example Python code using Apache Beam for session window processing

from apache_beam import Pipeline, window
from apache_beam.io import ReadFromPubSub
from apache_beam.options.pipeline_options import PipelineOptions

options = PipelineOptions([
    '--streaming'
])

with Pipeline(options=options) as p:
    (p
     | 'Read From Pub/Sub' >> ReadFromPubSub(subscription='your_subscription_here')
     | 'Apply Session Windows' >> window.WindowInto(window.Sessions(10 * 60))  # 10 minutes gap
     | 'Process Events in Session' >> beam.Map(process_session_events)
     | 'Write Results' >> beam.io.WriteToSomeSink(sink_options))
```
This code snippet showcases a streaming pipeline using Apache Beam, applying session windows to group events based on activity periods. It demonstrates the handling of unbounded data streams, processing each session of events, and writing the results to a specified sink.
