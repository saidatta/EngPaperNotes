Understanding the concept of **parallel speedup** versus **comparative speedups** is crucial when evaluating the performance improvements of parallel computing techniques. These two metrics are commonly used but often misunderstood or misinterpreted without proper context. Let's dive into the details to clarify these concepts and their differences.

### **1. Definitions**

#### **1.1 Parallel Speedup (Serial-to-Parallel Speedup)**
- **Parallel speedup** measures the performance improvement of a parallel implementation compared to its sequential (serial) version.
- It quantifies how much faster a task runs when parallelized, typically using multiple cores or accelerators like GPUs, as opposed to running on a single CPU core.
- **Formula**: 
  \[
  \text{Parallel Speedup} = \frac{T_{\text{serial}}}{T_{\text{parallel}}}
  \]
  where \( T_{\text{serial}} \) is the execution time of the serial implementation and \( T_{\text{parallel}} \) is the execution time of the parallel implementation.

- **Purpose**: This metric primarily helps to understand the benefits of parallelism and how much faster a task can be executed using multiple processing units. However, it doesn't make a fair comparison between different types of hardware architectures (e.g., CPU vs. GPU).

#### **1.2 Comparative Speedup (Between Architectures)**
- **Comparative speedup** measures the performance difference between two different hardware architectures or parallel implementations.
- It usually compares how well the same task runs on different systems, such as comparing an MPI implementation on multiple CPU cores versus a GPU-based implementation.
- **Formula**:
  \[
  \text{Comparative Speedup} = \frac{T_{\text{system 1}}}{T_{\text{system 2}}}
  \]
  where \( T_{\text{system 1}} \) is the runtime on one hardware system (e.g., CPU) and \( T_{\text{system 2}} \) is the runtime on another system (e.g., GPU).

- **Purpose**: This type of speedup is crucial when assessing which architecture performs better for a given task, considering specific hardware capabilities. It provides insight into which system might be a better choice for certain workloads.
### **2. Understanding the Difference**
The key distinction between **parallel speedup** and **comparative speedup** lies in the nature of the comparison:
- **Parallel speedup** focuses on measuring the impact of parallelizing an algorithm or program, comparing a serial run with its parallel counterpart.
- **Comparative speedup** emphasizes the relative performance of different hardware architectures, aiming to determine which system performs better when running a particular application.
For example, comparing a GPU-based implementation to a serial CPU implementation can lead to misleading results in terms of comparative performance, as a fair comparison should be made between parallel CPU implementations and GPU implementations.
### **3. Real-World Implications of These Metrics**

#### **3.1 Misleading Performance Comparisons**
- Comparing a high-end GPU against a low-end CPU without context can result in misleading conclusions.
- The effectiveness of comparative speedup depends on the specific capabilities and the release dates of the hardware being compared.

To provide context and clarity in these comparisons, we suggest adding qualifiers to the speedup terms

| **Qualifier**                 | **Explanation**                                                     |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **(Best 2016)**               | Indicates the comparison uses the best hardware released in 2016.  |
| **(Common 2016)** or **(2016)** | Represents more mainstream parts released in 2016, not top-end.    |
| **(Mac 2016)**                | Compares components in a 2016 Mac laptop/desktop.                  |
| **(GPU 2016:CPU 2013)**       | Highlights the mismatch in hardware release years between GPU and CPU. |

This qualification helps to provide a clearer understanding of the performance comparison, specifying the hardware used and its release context.

### **4. Factors Affecting Speedup**
Several factors can influence the calculation of parallel and comparative speedups, such as:
- **Hardware Architecture**: The type and number of CPU cores, GPU cores, memory speed, and interconnects can greatly impact performance.
- **Code Optimization**: Optimizations specific to the architecture (e.g., vectorization on CPUs or memory coalescing on GPUs) can change the effective speedup.
- **Scalability**: How well the algorithm scales with increased parallelism affects parallel speedup significantly.
- **Data Transfer Overhead**: In GPU computations, data transfer times between CPU and GPU play a crucial role and might reduce the observed speedup.

### **5. Pitfalls in Measuring Speedups**

When reporting speedup numbers, it's essential to:
- **Avoid cherry-picking hardware**: Comparing a fast GPU with a slow CPU can create a biased performance ratio that does not represent a fair comparison.
- **Consider hardware release dates**: Mentioning the release year of the hardware components helps in understanding the relative performance in a historical context.
- **Contextualize the numbers**: Without proper qualifiers, speedup numbers can be meaningless and lead to unfair comparisons.

### **6. Why Normalization is Important**

Normalizing the comparison to specific conditions or benchmarks is crucial to make performance results more meaningful. For example, modern comparisons should consider factors like:
- **Energy Efficiency**: Comparing the performance of GPUs and CPUs based on energy consumption.
- **Hardware Specifications**: Number of cores, clock speed, memory bandwidth, and power consumption.

### **7. Practical Example: Speedup Calculation**

Let's consider an example to illustrate the difference:

1. **Parallel Speedup Example:**
   - **Serial CPU Execution Time**: 100 seconds
   - **Parallel Execution on 4 CPU cores**: 25 seconds
   \[
   \text{Parallel Speedup} = \frac{100}{25} = 4
   \]
   This indicates a 4x speedup when running the program on 4 cores compared to a single core.

2. **Comparative Speedup Example:**
   - **Execution Time on GPU**: 10 seconds
   - **Execution Time on 4 CPU cores**: 25 seconds
   \[
   \text{Comparative Speedup} = \frac{25}{10} = 2.5
   \]
   This shows that the GPU is 2.5 times faster than the multi-core CPU implementation.

### **8. Conclusion**

**Parallel speedup** is primarily used to measure how well an application scales from a serial to a parallel implementation. **Comparative speedup**, on the other hand, is used to compare the relative performance between different parallel architectures. Properly understanding and using these metrics, along with clear context and qualifiers, will help in making fair and accurate performance comparisons.

By using appropriate qualifiers and understanding the distinction between these measures, we can provide more accurate and meaningful performance insights that guide the selection of hardware and parallel computing strategies.
