## **5.1 Algorithm Analysis for Parallel Computing Applications** <a name="algorithm-analysis"></a>

### **Definitions**
- **Parallel Algorithm**: A step-by-step computational procedure that emphasizes concurrency to solve a problem efficiently.
- **Parallel Pattern**: A recurring code structure that can be applied across different problems to facilitate parallel computation.

### **Algorithmic Complexity Analysis**
Algorithmic complexity measures the number of operations required to complete an algorithm. It’s typically expressed using asymptotic notation:
- **Big O (O)**: Worst-case complexity (e.g., O(N²))
- **Big Ω (Ω)**: Best-case complexity
- **Big Θ (Θ)**: Average-case complexity

### **Computational Complexity vs. Time Complexity**
- **Computational Complexity**: Refers to the number of computational steps required by an algorithm, including the number of parallel operations that can be executed simultaneously.
- **Time Complexity**: Takes into account the actual cost of memory operations, data transfers, and cache efficiency.

#### **Rust Example: Linear vs. Binary Search Complexity**
```rust
fn linear_search(arr: &[i32], target: i32) -> Option<usize> {
    for (index, &value) in arr.iter().enumerate() {
        if value == target {
            return Some(index);
        }
    }
    None
}

fn binary_search(arr: &[i32], target: i32) -> Option<usize> {
    let mut low = 0;
    let mut high = arr.len();
    while low < high {
        let mid = (low + high) / 2;
        if arr[mid] == target {
            return Some(mid);
        } else if arr[mid] < target {
            low = mid + 1;
        } else {
            high = mid;
        }
    }
    None
}
```
- **Linear Search Complexity**: O(N)
- **Binary Search Complexity**: O(log N)
- In practical applications, a linear search may outperform a binary search for small data sets due to better cache utilization.

### **Equation Analysis**
- **Time Complexity Equation for Linear Search**:
  \[
  \text{Time Complexity} = \frac{N}{16} \times \text{Cache Load Time}
  \]
- **Binary Search Time Complexity**:
  \[
  \text{Time Complexity} = \log_2 \left( \frac{N}{16} \right) \times \text{Cache Load Time}
  \]

The real-time performance of these searches depends on how data is fetched and stored in cache memory, highlighting the importance of cache efficiency in algorithm design.

## **5.2 Performance Models versus Algorithmic Complexity** <a name="performance-models"></a>

### **Importance of Performance Models**
- **Algorithmic Complexity** is insufficient for evaluating the real-world performance of parallel algorithms due to hidden constants and hardware variations.
- **Performance Models** include actual hardware characteristics such as cache lines, data movement, and memory bandwidth to give a more accurate picture of an algorithm's efficiency.

### **Example: Hash Sort vs. Comparison Sort**
- **Hash Sort**: Θ(1) for each element, Θ(N) for all elements — Highly parallelizable.
- **Comparison Sort**: Best possible comparison-based sort complexity is O(N log N) — Limited parallelism.

#### **Equation Analysis**
- **Speedup Equation for Parallel Execution**:
  \[
  \text{Speedup} = \frac{\text{Serial Time}}{\text{Parallel Time}} = \frac{O(N^2)}{O\left(\frac{N}{P}\right)}
  \]
  where \( P \) is the number of processors.

## **5.3 Parallel Algorithms** <a name="parallel-algorithms"></a>

### **Key Concepts in Parallel Algorithm Design**
1. **Concurrency**: Ability to execute multiple tasks simultaneously.
2. **Spatial Locality**: Ensuring data accessed together is stored close in memory.
3. **Load Balancing**: Distributing work evenly across all processing units.
4. **Synchronization**: Minimizing the time threads spend waiting for each other.

### **Rust Example: Parallel Prefix Sum (Scan)**
```rust
use rayon::prelude::*;

fn parallel_prefix_sum(arr: &mut [i32]) {
    arr.par_iter_mut()
        .enumerate()
        .for_each(|(i, value)| {
            if i > 0 {
                *value += arr[i - 1];
            }
        });
}

fn main() {
    let mut data = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    parallel_prefix_sum(&mut data);
    println!("{:?}", data); // Output: [1, 3, 6, 10, 15]
}
```
- **Time Complexity**: O(log N) for parallel prefix sum using tree-based reduction.
- **Spatial Locality**: Data is accessed in a manner that leverages cache efficiency.

## **5.4 Advanced Sorting Techniques** <a name="advanced-sorting"></a>

### **Comparison Sort vs. Hash Sort**
- **Comparison Sort**: Limited parallelism, requiring synchronous operations across elements.
- **Hash Sort**: Breaks comparison-based limitations, enabling Θ(N) sorting for independent operations.

#### **Equation Analysis**
- **Comparison Sort Complexity**:
  \[
  T_{\text{comparison}} = O(N \log N)
  \]
- **Hash Sort Complexity**:
  \[
  T_{\text{hash}} = Θ(N/P)
  \]

### **Rust Implementation: Parallel QuickSort**
```rust
use rayon::prelude::*;

fn parallel_quicksort(arr: &mut [i32]) {
    if arr.len() > 1 {
        let mid = partition(arr);
        let (left, right) = arr.split_at_mut(mid);
        rayon::join(|| parallel_quicksort(left), || parallel_quicksort(right));
    }
}

fn partition(arr: &mut [i32]) -> usize {
    let pivot = arr[arr.len() / 2];
    let mut low = 0;
    let mut high = arr.len() - 1;

    loop {
        while arr[low] < pivot { low += 1; }
        while arr[high] > pivot { high -= 1; }
        if low >= high { return high; }
        arr.swap(low, high);
    }
}
```
- **Parallel QuickSort Complexity**: Expected O(N log N) with significantly reduced depth of recursion in parallel execution.
