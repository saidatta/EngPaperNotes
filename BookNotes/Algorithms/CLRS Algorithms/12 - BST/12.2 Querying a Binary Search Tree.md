#### 12.2 Querying a Binary Search Tree - Overview
- **Operations**: Supports SEARCH, MINIMUM, MAXIMUM, SUCCESSOR, PREDECESSOR.
- **Time Complexity**: Each operation can be supported in O(h) time, where h is the height of the tree.
#### Searching in a Binary Search Tree
- **Procedure**: TREE-SEARCH or ITERATIVE-TREE-SEARCH.
- **Algorithm**:
  - If the node is NIL or the key is equal to the node's key, return the node.
  - If the key is less than the node's key, search the left subtree; otherwise, search the right subtree.
- **Time Complexity**: O(h).
##### Searching Algorithms
- **Recursive Search**:
  ```python
  def tree_search(x, k):
      if x is None or k == x.key:
          return x
      if k < x.key:
          return tree_search(x.left, k)
      else:
          return tree_search(x.right, k)
  ```
- **Iterative Search**:
  ```python
  def iterative_tree_search(x, k):
      while x is not None and k != x.key:
          if k < x.key:
              x = x.left
          else:
              x = x.right
      return x
  ```
#### Finding Minimum and Maximum
- **Minimum**: Follow left children from the root until a NIL is encountered.
- **Maximum**: Follow right children from the root until a NIL is encountered.
- **Algorithms**:
  - `TREE-MINIMUM(x)`: Continuously move to `x.left` until NIL.
  - `TREE-MAXIMUM(x)`: Continuously move to `x.right` until NIL.
#### Successor and Predecessor
- **Successor**: Next node in an inorder tree walk.
  - If the right subtree is nonempty: The successor is the minimum in the right subtree.
  - Otherwise: The successor is the lowest ancestor whose left child is also an ancestor of the node.
- **Predecessor**: The previous node in an inorder tree walk.
  - Mirror algorithm to successor.
- **Algorithm for Successor**:
  ```python
  def tree_successor(x):
      if x.right is not None:
          return tree_minimum(x.right)
      y = x.parent
      while y is not None and x == y.right:
          x = y
          y = y.parent
      return y
  ```
#### Theorem 12.2
- **Statement**: SEARCH, MINIMUM, MAXIMUM, SUCCESSOR, and PREDECESSOR operations can be implemented to run in O(h) time on a binary search tree of height h.

#### Python Implementation of Successor in a BST
```python
def tree_minimum(x):
    while x.left is not None:
        x = x.left
    return x

def tree_successor(x):
    if x.right is not None:
        return tree_minimum(x.right)
    y = x.parent
    while y is not None and x == y.right:
        x = y
        y = y.parent
    return y
```
