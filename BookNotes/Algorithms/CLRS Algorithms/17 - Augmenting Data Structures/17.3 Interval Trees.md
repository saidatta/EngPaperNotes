#### Overview of Interval Trees
- **Purpose**: Efficient management of dynamic sets of intervals.
- **Use Case**: Identifying overlapping intervals, useful in databases and scheduling applications.
- **Interval Definition**: Represented by an object `i` with attributes `i.low` and `i.high` for the endpoints.

#### Concept of Interval Trichotomy
- **Definition**: Any two intervals `i` and `i'` satisfy exactly one of these conditions:
  a. Overlap: `i.low ≤ i'.high` and `i'.low ≤ i.high`.
  b. `i` is to the left of `i'`: `i.high < i'.low`.
  c. `i` is to the right of `i'`: `i'.high < i.low`.
- **Figure 17.3**: Illustrates these conditions with examples.

#### Structure of Interval Trees
- **Base Structure**: Red-black tree.
- **Node Contents**: Each node `x` contains an interval `x.int`.
- **Key**: The low endpoint of the interval, `x.int.low`.
- **Additional Attribute**: Each node `x` also contains `x.max`, the maximum endpoint in the subtree rooted at `x`.

#### Operations on Interval Trees
1. **INTERVAL-INSERT(T, x)**: Adds element `x` with an interval to the tree `T`.
2. **INTERVAL-DELETE(T, x)**: Removes element `x` from the tree `T`.
3. **INTERVAL-SEARCH(T, i)**: Finds an element in the tree `T` whose interval overlaps with interval `i`.

#### INTERVAL-SEARCH Procedure
- **Process**: Starts at the root and proceeds downward.
- **Termination**: When an overlapping interval is found or the search reaches the sentinel `T.nil`.
- **Time Complexity**: O(lg n) due to the height of the red-black tree.
- **Example**: Searches for overlapping intervals, handling both successful and unsuccessful cases.
- **Theorem 17.2**: Validates the correctness of INTERVAL-SEARCH.

#### INTERVAL-SEARCH Algorithm
```python
INTERVAL-SEARCH(T, i):
    x = T.root
    while x ≠ T.nil and i does not overlap x.int:
        if x.left ≠ T.nil and x.left.max ≥ i.low:
            x = x.left
        else:
            x = x.right
    return x
```

#### Correctness of INTERVAL-SEARCH
- **Logic**: Ensures that the search always moves in the direction of a potential overlap.
- **Cases Handled**:
  - **Going Left**: If `x.left.max` ≥ `i.low`, potentially overlaps in the left subtree.
  - **Going Right**: No overlap in the left subtree, so search the right subtree.
- **Proof (Theorem 17.2)**: Demonstrates that the algorithm does not miss any overlapping intervals in the tree.

#### Conclusion
- **Utility**: Interval trees are effective for managing dynamic sets of intervals and finding overlaps.
- **Performance**: Provides efficient operations, maintaining the O(lg n) complexity characteristic of red-black trees.
