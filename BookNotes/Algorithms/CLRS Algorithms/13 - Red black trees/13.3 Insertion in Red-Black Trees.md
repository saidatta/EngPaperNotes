#### 13.3 Insertion - Overview
- **Objective**: Insert a node into a red-black tree while maintaining its properties.
- **Time Complexity**: O(lg n) for a red-black tree with n internal nodes.

#### RB-INSERT Procedure
- **Modification of TREE-INSERT**: RB-INSERT includes additional steps to maintain red-black properties.
- **Key Steps**:
  1. **Standard Binary Search Tree Insertion**: Insert node `z` as in a regular binary search tree.
  2. **Coloring**: Node `z` is colored red.
  3. **Fix-up**: Call `RB-INSERT-FIXUP(T, z)` to correct potential red-black property violations.

#### RB-INSERT-FIXUP Procedure
- **Purpose**: Restores red-black properties potentially violated by RB-INSERT.
- **Loop Invariant**:
  a. Node `z` is red.
  b. If `z.p` is the root, then `z.p` is black.
  c. At most one red-black property is violated.
- **Cases Handled**:
  1. **Case 1**: Both `z` and its parent are red, and `z`'s uncle is red.
  2. **Case 2**: `z`'s uncle is black and `z` is a right child.
  3. **Case 3**: `z`'s uncle is black and `z` is a left child.

#### Detailed Explanation of Cases
- **Case 1**: Recolor and move `z` to its grandparent.
- **Case 2 to 3 Transition**: A left rotation transforming case 2 into case 3.
- **Case 3**: Recolor and right rotation to fix the violation and terminate the loop.

#### Figure 13.4 and 13.5-13.6 - Visualization
- **Figure 13.4**: Depicts the operation of RB-INSERT-FIXUP with various cases.
- **Figure 13.5**: Illustrates Case 1 with changes in colors and pointers.
- **Figure 13.6**: Shows the transition from Case 2 to Case 3 and the resulting changes.

#### Analysis of RB-INSERT
- **Running Time**: O(lg n) due to the height bound of red-black trees.
- **Rotation Count**: No more than two rotations are performed.

### Code Example

#### Python Implementation of RB-INSERT and RB-INSERT-FIXUP
```python
def rb_insert(T, z):
    y = T.nil
    x = T.root
    while x != T.nil:
        y = x
        if z.key < x.key:
            x = x.left
        else:
            x = x.right
    z.p = y
    if y == T.nil:
        T.root = z
    elif z.key < y.key:
        y.left = z
    else:
        y.right = z
    z.left = T.nil
    z.right = T.nil
    z.color = RED
    rb_insert_fixup(T, z)

def rb_insert_fixup(T, z):
    while z.p.color == RED:
        # Cases are handled here
        # Rotation and color adjustments
    T.root.color = BLACK
```

### Practical Implications for Software Engineers
- **Tree Modification**: Implementing RB-INSERT correctly is critical to maintaining tree balance.
- **Understanding Fix-up**: RB-INSERT-FIXUP is key to preserving red-black tree properties after insertion.
- **Performance Consideration**: Efficiently maintaining red-black properties is essential for optimal tree operations.
