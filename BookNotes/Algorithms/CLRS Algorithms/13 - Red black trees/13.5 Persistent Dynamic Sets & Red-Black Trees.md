#### 13-1 Persistent Dynamic Sets
- **Objective**: Maintain past versions of a dynamic set efficiently during updates.
- **Challenge**: Avoiding the costly approach of copying the entire set for each modification.
#### Implementation Using Binary Search Trees
1. **Methodology**:
   - Maintain a separate root for every version of the set.
   - Partial copying of the tree for updates, sharing some nodes with the original tree.
   - Illustrated in Figure 13.8 (a) & (b).

2. **PERSISTENT-TREE-INSERT Procedure**:
   - Inserts a node `z` into a persistent binary search tree `T`, returning a new tree `T'`.
   - Utilizes `COPY-NODE(x)` to duplicate necessary nodes.
   - Example: Inserting key 5 involves copying and creating new nodes, as shown in Figure 13.8 (b).

3. **Analysis**:
   - **Time Complexity**: O(h) for a tree height of h.
   - **Space Requirement**: Proportional to the number of nodes copied.

4. **Challenges with Parent Attribute**:
   - Inclusion of `parent` attribute requires additional copying.
   - Time and Space Complexity becomes Ω(n), with `n` being the number of nodes.

5. **Improvement Using Red-Black Trees**:
   - Guarantees worst-case running time and space of O(lg n) per operation.
   - Assumes all keys are distinct.
#### 13-2 Join Operation on Red-Black Trees
- **Objective**: Implement `RB-JOIN(T1, x, T2)` operation.
- **Condition**: For any `x1` in `T1` and `x2` in `T2`, `x1.key ≤ x.key ≤ x2.key`.
1. **Storing Black-Height (bh)**:
   - Argue that `RB-INSERT` and `RB-DELETE` can maintain `bh` without extra storage or time.
   - O(1) time per node visited to determine the black-height.

2. **Implementation Steps**:
   - **Find Node `y` in `T1`**: Black node with largest key where `T1.bh ≥ T2.bh`.
   - **Subtree Replacement**: Replace `Ty` with `Ty ⋃ {x} ⋃ T2` in O(1) time.
   - **Node Coloring**: Determine color for `x` to maintain red-black properties.
   - **Enforcing Properties**: Ensure properties 2 and 4 are met in O(lg n) time.
   - **Handling T1.bh ≤ T2.bh**: Describe symmetric situation and argue for O(lg n) running time.
#### 13-3 AVL Trees
- **Characteristics**: Height-balanced binary search trees.
- **Height Proof**: Show AVL tree with `n` nodes has height O(lg n) using Fibonacci numbers.
1. **BALANCE Procedure**:
   - Balances a subtree rooted at `x` where heights differ by at most 2.
   - Returns the new root of the altered subtree.
2. **AVL-INSERT Procedure**:
   - Inserts node `z` into AVL tree `T`, maintaining AVL properties.
   - Runs in O(lg n) time and performs O(lg n) rotations.
3. **Additional Notes**:
   - AVL trees originated in 1962.
   - Variations include red-black trees, AA-trees, and others like 2-3 trees and B-trees.
   - Alternatives to balanced binary trees include splay trees and skip lists.
#### Practical Implications for Software Engineers
- **Persistent Sets**: Crucial for algorithms requiring access to historical data states.
- **Red-Black Tree Operations**: Essential for balancing and maintaining efficient search trees.
- **AVL Trees**: Important for applications where height-balanced trees are required for efficient operations.
