### Obsidian Notes: Introduction to Algorithms (4th Edition) - Chapter 

#### Overview
Chapter 22.2 explores the computation of single-source shortest paths in directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), which are especially efficient due to the absence of cycles.

#### Key Concepts
- **Graph Type**: The algorithm specifically targets weighted dags (directed acyclic graphs).
- **Absence of Negative-Weight Cycles**: Dags cannot contain negative-weight cycles, simplifying the shortest-path problem.
- **Topological Sort**: The algorithm starts with a topological sort of the vertices, which orders vertices linearly based on precedence.

#### DAG-Shortest-Paths Algorithm
- **Procedure**: 
  1. **Topologically Sort** the vertices of the graph.
  2. **Initialize** single-source paths using `INITIALIZE-SINGLE-SOURCE(G, s)`.
  3. **Relax** edges in the order of the topologically sorted vertices.
- **Relaxation**: Involves updating the shortest path estimate and predecessor for each vertex.
- **Implementation**:
  - `DAG-SHORTEST-PATHS(G, w, s)`: Main procedure.
  - `RELAX(u, v, w)`: Called for each edge in the graph.

#### Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: Θ(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
- **Efficiency**: The algorithm is efficient due to linear time complexity in the size of the graph.

#### Correctness
- **Theorem 22.5**: At the end of the `DAG-SHORTEST-PATHS` procedure, v.d = δ(s, v) for all vertices v ∈ V, and the predecessor subgraph forms a shortest-paths tree.

#### Application
- **Critical Path Analysis in PERT Charts**: Used in project management to identify the sequence of dependent tasks that determine the duration of the project. The algorithm can find the longest path in the DAG, representing the critical path.
- **Modifications for Critical Path**:
  - Negate edge weights and run `DAG-SHORTEST-PATHS`.
  - Replace "∞" with "−∞" in `INITIALIZE-SINGLE-SOURCE` and ">" with "<" in `RELAX`.

#### Example
- **Figure 22.5**: Illustration of the algorithm's execution on a sample graph, showing changes in vertex estimates and predecessors at each iteration.

#### Exercises
- Exercise suggestions include implementing the algorithm on various DAGs and exploring its behavior under different edge weight configurations.

These notes provide a summary and key insights from Chapter 22.2 on single-source shortest paths in DAGs. The chapter's focus on DAGs offers an efficient approach to solving shortest-path problems where cycles are absent, making it particularly relevant for certain types of graph-based problems, such as project scheduling.
