#### Overview
Chapter 19.2 introduces the linked-list representation for managing disjoint sets, essential for grouping elements and performing operations like union and find.

#### Linked-List Representation
- **Structure**: Each set is a linked list with `head` and `tail` attributes.
- **Elements**: Every element in the list has:
  - A set member.
  - A next pointer.
  - A back pointer to the set object.
- **Representative**: The first object in the list.

#### Operations Efficiency
1. **MAKE-SET(x)**: O(1) time. Creates a new list with `x`.
2. **FIND-SET(x)**: O(1) time. Follows the pointer from `x` to its set object and returns the first list member.

#### UNION Operation
- **Implementation**: Appends one list to another.
- **Time Complexity**: Linear in the length of the appended list, as it updates pointers in each object.
- **Example**: `UNION(g, e)` in Figure 19.2(b) updates pointers in several objects.

#### Sequence of Operations
- A sequence of `m` operations on `n` objects can require Θ(n²) time.
- Each `UNION` operation updates a number of objects, leading to an arithmetic series.
- Amortized time per operation: Θ(n).

#### Weighted-Union Heuristic
- **Strategy**: Append the shorter list to the longer one.
- **Complexity**: Each `UNION` can still be Ω(n) time, but over `m` operations, the total time is O(m + n lg n).
- **Theorem 19.1**: For a sequence of `m` MAKE-SET, UNION, and FIND-SET operations (with `n` being MAKE-SET operations), the total time is O(m + n lg n) using this heuristic.

#### Proof of Theorem 19.1
- **Key Insight**: Each object's pointer updates at most ⌈lg n⌉ times.
- **Analysis**:
  - After each update, the set size at least doubles.
  - Total time for updating pointers in all `UNION` operations is O(n lg n).
  - Accounting for updating tail pointers and list lengths, which take Θ(1) per `UNION`.
- **Total Time**: O(m + n lg n) for the entire sequence of `m` operations.

#### Practical Implications for Software Engineers
Understanding the linked-list representation of disjoint sets is vital for applications involving grouping and managing disjoint sets efficiently. The linked-list approach offers constant-time operations for MAKE-SET and FIND-SET, making it suitable for scenarios where these operations are predominant. The weighted-union heuristic further optimizes performance for sequences of operations, particularly in contexts where union operations are frequent.
