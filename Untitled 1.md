Below is an example **comparison table** summarizing key considerations and indicative pricing for **Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA) 2XL** versus **self-managed Airflow on Amazon EKS (using a 2xlarge instance)**.

| **Category**                        | **MWAA (2XL Environment)**                                                                                                | **Self-Managed Airflow on EKS**                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Base Compute Cost**               | **\$3.96/hour** for 1 Scheduler, 1 Worker, 1 Web Server <br> \~\$2,946/month (744 hours)                                  | Depends on instance type & pricing model. For **c5.2xlarge** at \~\$0.0408/hour: <br> \~\$30.35/month (24/7) per node (based on the provided table)                                   |
| **Additional Instances**            | - **Worker:** \$0.88/hour (2XL) <br> - **Scheduler:** \$0.88/hour (2XL) <br> - **Web Server:** \$0.44/hour (2XL)          | Scale out by adding more 2xlarge nodes or other instance types in EKS. <br> (Same instance rate, e.g., \$0.0408/hour each per the provided price list, or higher if using On-Demand.) |
| **Metadata Database**               | **\$0.10/GB-month** (managed by MWAA)                                                                                     | Must provision & manage your own DB (e.g., RDS for Postgres). <br> Costs vary: ~\$15–\$100+/month depending on size and performance requirements.                                     |
| **EKS Control Plane**               | Not applicable (MWAA is fully managed)                                                                                    | **\$0.10/hour** (~\$74/month) for EKS cluster control plane unless using Fargate-only.                                                                                                |
| **Integration & Setup**             | - Simple to set up via AWS Console <br> - Automatic provisioning of environment components                                | - Requires creation of EKS cluster, networking, IAM, and container-based Airflow setup <br> - Typically deployed via Helm charts or manual container orchestration                    |
| **Scaling & Maintenance**           | - Automatic scaling for workers (with cost per additional worker) <br> - AWS manages environment patches, upgrades        | - You manage scaling of pods/nodes in EKS <br> - You handle Airflow version upgrades, environment patching, high availability setup, etc.                                             |
| **Customization & Plugins**         | - Some limitations on OS-level changes and advanced custom configurations <br> - Supports custom plugins in specific ways | - Full control over Airflow environment, OS, and Python libraries <br> - Easier to install custom or non-standard plugins                                                             |
| **Operational Overhead**            | - Minimal DevOps overhead <br> - Monitoring & logging integrated with CloudWatch logs                                     | - Higher operational overhead for cluster management, networking, patching, logging, etc.                                                                                             |
| **Example Monthly Baseline** (24/7) | - **\$2,946** (base for 2XL) <br> + Additional workers, schedulers, web servers, DB storage                               | - **\$30** for 1 c5.2xlarge node + ~\$74 (EKS control plane) + DB cost (say \$50–\$100) <br> → \~\$154–\$204/month total (not counting possible additional nodes).                    |
| **Use Case Fit**                    | - Great for teams wanting a fully managed solution <br> - Fewer internal DevOps resources                                 | - Better for teams with container/Kubernetes expertise <br> - Potentially **much cheaper** at scale, but more complex to operate                                                      |

### Key Observations

- **Pricing**: MWAA (2XL) can be substantially more expensive on a per-hour basis than running your own 2xlarge nodes in EKS.  
- **Management vs. Customization**: MWAA is simpler and fully managed by AWS, while EKS offers greater flexibility and control—at the cost of extra setup and maintenance.  
- **Scaling & Additional Components**: MWAA charges separately for extra Worker, Scheduler, and Web Server instances, while on EKS, you can add nodes or pods based on your own scaling policies.  

This table should help you visualize the primary cost drivers and operational trade-offs between **MWAA 2XL** and **Airflow on EKS with 2xlarge** instances.
