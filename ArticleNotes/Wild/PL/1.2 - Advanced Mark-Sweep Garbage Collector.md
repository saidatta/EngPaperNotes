# Overview
In the previous notes, we built a **simple mark-sweep garbage collector** and saw that even a straightforward approach can be production-ready. However, real-world language runtimes often employ more sophisticated techniques to **reduce collection pauses**, **improve throughput**, and **handle large heaps** more gracefully. 

In this section, we build upon the basic mark-sweep collector and discuss **more advanced concepts**:

1. **Cycle Detection and Non-Recursive Marking**  
2. **Optimized Data Structures for Marking**  
3. **Tri-Color Marking**  
4. **Generational / Incremental Collection**  
5. **Concurrent / Parallel Mark-Sweep**  
6. **Memory Compaction**  

While each concept could fill its own paper, this guide aims to show you what real-world collectors do to refine the same basic process we described earlier.

---

# 1. Cycle Detection and Non-Recursive Marking
In the simple mark-sweep collector, we relied on a **recursive** `mark()` function:
```c
void mark(Object* object) {
  if (object->marked) return;
  object->marked = 1;

  if (object->type == OBJ_PAIR) {
    mark(object->head);
    mark(object->tail);
  }
}
```
A major limitation is that a deeply nested structure or a long cycle can **overflow** the call stack. Production GCs often avoid deep recursion by:

- **Using an explicit stack (or queue)** in the heap or on the C stack to manage objects to mark.
- **Detecting and breaking cycles early** in custom data structures.

### 1.1 Non-Recursive (Stack-Based) Mark Implementation
Instead of calling `mark` recursively, we can use our own stack to **iteratively** process references:

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

#define MARK_STACK_MAX 1024

void markNonRecursive(VM* vm, Object* start) {
  // Use an explicit stack to hold objects to mark
  Object* stack[MARK_STACK_MAX];
  int top = 0;

  // Push the initial object
  stack[top++] = start;

  while (top > 0) {
    Object* obj = stack[--top];
    if (obj->marked) continue;

    obj->marked = 1;

    // If it's a pair, push its children
    if (obj->type == OBJ_PAIR) {
      if (obj->head && !obj->head->marked) {
        stack[top++] = obj->head;
      }
      if (obj->tail && !obj->tail->marked) {
        stack[top++] = obj->tail;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then, our `markAll()` might look like:
```c
void markAll(VM* vm) {
  for (int i = 0; i < vm->stackSize; i++) {
    if (vm->stack[i] != NULL) {
      markNonRecursive(vm, vm->stack[i]);
    }
  }
}
```
This avoids **stack overflow** from excessive recursion and explicitly manages the object references we still need to explore.

# 2. Optimized Data Structures for Marking
Our prior approach used a **linked list** of all objects. Accessing objects is sequential, and removing them in the sweep phase can be tricky with pointer-to-pointer manipulation.  

### 2.1 Object Pool / Blocks
An **alternative** is to use **pools** or **blocks** of pre-allocated objects:

- **Pool**: A contiguous memory region subdivided into equal-size “slots” for objects of certain sizes.
- **Block**: A chunk of memory that can hold a varying number of objects, often used in generational collectors.

Instead of a `linked list`, each block keeps track of which slots are in use. This can improve:
- **Locality of reference** for the CPU cache.
- **Faster sweep** if you know exactly where to check for unmarked objects.

However, implementing pools requires additional metadata and can be more complex.

---

# 3. Tri-Color Marking
Our basic mark-sweep sets a **marked** bit. Real collectors commonly use a **tri-color** model for clarity (though you can implement it with just one bit if you’re clever).

1. **White**: Objects not yet visited (unmarked).  
2. **Gray**: Objects recognized as reachable but whose children haven’t all been processed.  
3. **Black**: Objects fully visited (all children are known).

**Algorithm** (high-level):
1. **Initialize** all objects to **white**.
2. **Move** root objects (from the stack) to **gray** and add them to a marking queue.
3. **While** the gray queue isn’t empty, take an object from it:
   - **Visit** each of its references. If any child is **white**, turn it **gray** and enqueue it.
   - **Turn** the processed object to **black**.
4. After marking, any **white** object is unreachable -> **sweep** (free).

Though the tri-color approach can be done with one “marked” bit plus a queue, conceptually it’s easier to think in three sets (white, gray, black). This model also helps with **incremental or concurrent** GCs where the mutator (the rest of the program) continues while marking is in progress.

# 4. Generational / Incremental Collection
One weakness of a **stop-the-world** mark-sweep is that the program must **pause** entirely for the GC to do a full collection, which can be painful with large heaps.

## 4.1 Generational GC
**Generational** collectors rely on the **empirical observation** that most objects **die young**. So they:
1. Track objects in two (or more) “generations”: 
   - A **young** generation (nursery) for new allocations.
   - An **old** generation for survivors.
2. Collect the **young** generation **frequently** (it’s smaller, so it’s cheaper).  
3. **Promote** survivors (usually after N collections) to the **old** generation.  
4. Collect the **old** generation **less often**, because longer-lived objects tend to remain alive.

### Example: Write Barrier
When objects in the old generation point to newly allocated objects in the young generation, the collector needs to track these references. This is commonly done via a **write barrier**, a small piece of code inserted every time an object reference is written, to keep the GC’s data structures accurate.  

## 4.2 Incremental GC
An **incremental** collector breaks the marking/sweeping into smaller steps interleaved with the program execution. This reduces **pause times** at the cost of slightly more overhead (bookkeeping to ensure correctness even as the program mutates the heap during marking).

---

# 5. Concurrent / Parallel Mark-Sweep
### 5.1 Concurrent GC
**Concurrent** collection runs **in parallel** on multiple cores. The application (mutator) continues running while a separate thread (collector) does marking in the background. This requires **synchronization** or specialized algorithms (e.g., **snapshot-at-the-beginning** or **read-barriers**) to ensure the collector sees a consistent view of the heap.

### 5.2 Parallel Marking & Sweeping
Even if the GC pauses the program, using **multiple threads** to speed up marking can reduce pause times. The marking queue can be **work-stealed** among threads. The sweep phase can similarly be parallelized if the object list or pool is partitioned.

---

# 6. Memory Compaction
A drawback of **basic mark-sweep** is **heap fragmentation**. Over time, newly allocated objects may become scattered across memory, resulting in poor cache performance and possibly frequent calls to the OS memory allocator.

### 6.1 Copying Collection
Languages like **Lisp** (in early implementations) or **Erlang** often use a **copying** or **semispace** collector for younger objects:
1. The heap is split into two semi-spaces: **From-space** and **To-space**.
2. Active objects are **copied** to the To-space.  
3. Pointers are updated to reference the new addresses.  
4. Once done, the roles of the two spaces swap.

This completely avoids fragmentation since the To-space is always contiguous. But it requires additional overhead in copying live objects and updating references.

---

# Putting It All Together

## Hybrid Approaches
**Production systems** combine these techniques to get the best of all worlds:
1. **Generational**: Collect the nursery often, the old space occasionally.  
2. **Incremental** or **Concurrent**: Reduce pause times by interleaving GC with the main program.  
3. **Tri-Color** or **Card Marking**: Precisely track references in large heaps.  
4. **Compaction** (selectively or on entire generations) to reduce fragmentation.

**Any** of these advanced techniques still rely on the same fundamental principle:
1. Mark reachable objects (somehow).  
2. Free anything unmarked.

Hence, you can think of them as **variations** on the **mark-sweep** theme.

# Code Excerpts for Advanced Concepts

Below are brief code sketches illustrating some advanced features. These are **not** fully plug-and-play, but highlight typical enhancements.

## A. Tri-Color Marking with a Work Queue

```c
#include <stdbool.h>

typedef enum {
  COLOR_WHITE,
  COLOR_GRAY,
  COLOR_BLACK
} MarkColor;

typedef struct sObject {
  struct sObject* next;
  MarkColor color;        // tri-color instead of a single marked bit
  ObjectType type;
  union {
    int value;
    struct {
      struct sObject* head;
      struct sObject* tail;
    };
  };
} Object;

#define MARK_QUEUE_SIZE 1024

void triColorMark(VM* vm) {
  Object* queue[MARK_QUEUE_SIZE];
  int front = 0, back = 0;

  // Initialize all objects to white (not strictly necessary if default is white)
  // for (Object* obj = vm->firstObject; obj != NULL; obj = obj->next) {
  //   obj->color = COLOR_WHITE;
  // }

  // 1. Enqueue all objects from stack as GRAY
  for (int i = 0; i < vm->stackSize; i++) {
    Object* obj = vm->stack[i];
    if (obj && obj->color == COLOR_WHITE) {
      obj->color = COLOR_GRAY;
      queue[back++] = obj;
    }
  }

  // 2. Process the gray queue
  while (front < back) {
    Object* current = queue[front++];

    // For each child
    if (current->type == OBJ_PAIR) {
      if (current->head && current->head->color == COLOR_WHITE) {
        current->head->color = COLOR_GRAY;
        queue[back++] = current->head;
      }
      if (current->tail && current->tail->color == COLOR_WHITE) {
        current->tail->color = COLOR_GRAY;
        queue[back++] = current->tail;
      }
    }

    // Mark current as black
    current->color = COLOR_BLACK;
  }
}
```

## B. Partial / Incremental Collection
```c
// Pseudocode: break marking into small steps

void incrementalMarkStep(VM* vm, int workUnits) {
  // We'll keep a 'gray stack' or queue in VM
  while (workUnits > 0 && vm->grayCount > 0) {
    Object* current = popGray(vm);
    // Mark child references, push them onto gray stack if white...
    // ...
    current->color = COLOR_BLACK;
    workUnits--;
  }
  // If vm->grayCount == 0, we are done marking this cycle.
}
```
**Note**: The mutator (main program) must coordinate with the collector to maintain correct references if new objects appear or old references change.

# Conclusion
**Mark-sweep** is the **bedrock** of modern GC design. Even the most sophisticated systems are conceptually layering advanced features on top of a simple idea: **mark** what’s reachable, **sweep** what isn’t. The further refinements primarily aim to reduce **GC pause times**, manage **large heaps**, and improve **locality** and **performance**.

For a **PhD-level** engineer, the critical insights are:
1. **Garbage collection is a global property** of your runtime—small changes in your memory model can have big consequences for performance.  
2. **Advanced GCs** (generational, concurrent, incremental) revolve around the same mark-sweep logic, but handle partial collections or background work.  
3. **Implementation details** (pool allocation, tri-color marking, write barriers) matter for real systems.  

Continue experimenting:
- Implement a **non-recursive** mark phase in your simple GC to avoid stack overflows.
- Add a **nursery** for new allocations and see how quickly your short-lived objects vanish.
- Build a **tri-color** incremental collector to keep your language runtime responsive while collecting.

**Happy (Advanced) Collecting!**
