## 1. Introduction

**Redis** is widely used as a high-performance in-memory cache system. This article focuses on the **network model** of Redis, from its single-threaded design through the introduction of **multithreading** in version 6.0. We’ll see *why* Redis is so fast, the reasoning behind the single-thread approach, how it gradually embraced limited multithreading in 4.0 for asynchronous tasks, and finally, the **I/O threading** introduced in 6.0.

---

## 2. How Fast Is Redis?

An **official** benchmark suggests:
- A single Redis instance on an average Linux box can handle **80k+ QPS** on typical commands (O(N) or O(log(N))).
- With **pipelining**, that can exceed **1 million QPS**.

Hence, Redis is considered extremely performant as a caching solution.

### 2.1 Why Is Redis So Fast?

1. **Pure In-Memory** I/O: No heavy disk access for standard commands.
2. **I/O Multiplexing**: Uses epoll/kqueue/select for high-throughput event handling.
3. **Single-Threaded** Main Event Loop: Avoids overhead from context switching and locking.
4. **(Now, from v6.0)** Optional **I/O Multithreading** to further reduce overhead in network reads/writes.

---

## 3. Why a Single Thread Originally?

Redis’s creator and maintainers originally justified the single-thread approach because:
- **CPU** isn’t typically the main bottleneck for Redis; network and memory are.
- **Concurrent** overhead (context switching, lock contention) is avoided with a single thread.
- Simpler to implement and maintain; less chance of concurrency bugs.

**But**: Over time, as traffic increased and I/O demands grew, single-threaded network handling started to show limitations.

---

## 4. Is Redis *Really* Single-Threaded?

- **Core network event loop** up to Redis v6.0 was single-threaded.
- **However**, in Redis 4.0, some background asynchronous tasks were already using *additional threads* (e.g., big key deletion via `UNLINK`, `FLUSHALL ASYNC`).
- **From Redis 6.0 on**: We have **I/O threading** for the networking path, so the network model can utilize multiple threads for read/write. The logic that **executes** commands remains single-threaded, but reading and writing to sockets can be parallelized.

So, we can say that before v6.0, the main network path was single-threaded, though some background tasks used extra threads. After v6.0, the network I/O can also be multi-threaded.

---

## 5. Single-Threaded Event Loop (Pre-6.0)

### 5.1 Core Reactor Model

Prior to Redis 6.0, the **network model** was a **single-reactor** event loop:
1. **I/O Multiplexing** with `epoll`, `select`, or `kqueue` (abstracted in the Redis `ae` event library).
2. Single **main thread** handles all events (accepting connections, reading commands, executing them, writing replies).

**Workflow**:
1. **acceptTcpHandler**: Accept new client connection → create `client` struct → register read event (`readQueryFromClient`).
2. **readQueryFromClient**: On readable event, parse the request from the socket into `client->querybuf`, then call `processCommand`.
3. The command writes results to `client->buf` or `client->reply` (a dynamic list if 16 KB buffer is insufficient).
4. The **beforeSleep** step in the event loop flushes pending writes by calling `sendReplyToClient`.

### 5.2 Why Single-Thread?
- **No** lock overhead.
- **Simplicity** of code, easier to maintain.
- Typically, the overhead is *not* CPU-bound for standard queries.

---

## 6. Multithreaded Asynchronous Tasks (Redis 4.0)

Even though the **network** path was single-threaded, Redis 4.0 introduced threads for **asynchronous** tasks:
- **UNLINK**: Non-blocking version of `DEL` for large keys, doing bulk deletion in background threads.
- **FLUSHALL ASYNC** and **FLUSHDB ASYNC** similarly.

**Rationale**: Large deletion is time-consuming if done synchronously, blocking the main event loop. Offloading to worker threads avoids stalling other operations.

---

## 7. I/O Multithreading in Redis 6.0

Redis 6.0 introduced **I/O threading** to handle the networking aspect. This is a partial shift from the single-threaded approach.

### 7.1 Motivation

As traffic soared, **network I/O** grew into a bottleneck. The single main thread spent significant time reading/writing sockets. Meanwhile, multi-core systems had idle cores. So, using extra threads for socket read/write (while command execution remains single-threaded) boosts throughput.

### 7.2 Overall Design

**High-level**:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
   A[Main Thread (Event Loop)] --> B{I/O Threads}
   A -->|Distribute read tasks| B
   B -->|Read from client| B
   B -->|Parse partial request| B
   B -->|Signal main thread done| A
   A -->|Exec command <br> single-threaded| A
   A -->|Distribute write tasks| B
   B -->|Write back replies| B
   B -->|Signal main thread done| A
```

1. **Connection** accepted by main thread → create `client`.
2. On read-ready events, main thread queues clients into a `clients_pending_read`.
3. **I/O threads** are signaled; each picks some clients to do `readQueryFromClient`, storing data in `client->querybuf` (but **not** running commands).
4. Main thread waits until all threads finish reading, then it **executes** the commands in a single thread.
5. For replying, data is placed in `client->buf` / `client->reply`, and the main thread enqueues clients into `clients_pending_write`.
6. **I/O threads** handle the actual write to each socket. Then main thread finalizes if leftover data remains.

### 7.3 Key Points

- **Command execution** is still single-threaded for simplicity and no locking around data structures.
- **I/O threads** do **only** reading from sockets and writing back responses.
- The main thread does a “busy wait” or “poll” style synchronization with the I/O threads to ensure all reads/writes complete.

## 8. Source Code Analysis

**Note**: The code references are from Redis 6.0.10 (current stable around the time of writing).

### 8.1 Initialization

```c
/* Called during Redis startup */
void initThreadedIO(void) {
    server.io_threads_active = 0; // start with threads inactive

    // if user sets "io-threads" to 1, effectively no new threads are created
    if (server.io_threads_num == 1) return;

    // If user sets too many threads, fail
    if (server.io_threads_num > IO_THREADS_MAX_NUM) {
        serverLog(LL_WARNING,"Fatal: too many I/O threads configured. The max is %d.",
                  IO_THREADS_MAX_NUM);
        exit(1);
    }

    // Create the I/O threads
    for (int i = 0; i < server.io_threads_num; i++) {
        // For each thread, create a local task list
        io_threads_list[i] = listCreate();
        if (i == 0) continue; // Thread 0 is the main thread

        // init locks, spawn thread
        pthread_t tid;
        pthread_mutex_init(&io_threads_mutex[i], NULL);
        io_threads_pending[i] = 0;
        // lock the thread so it blocks until tasks are assigned
        pthread_mutex_lock(&io_threads_mutex[i]);
        // create the thread
        if (pthread_create(&tid, NULL, IOThreadMain, (void*)(long)i) != 0) {
            serverLog(LL_WARNING,"Fatal: Can't initialize IO thread.");
            exit(1);
        }
        io_threads[i] = tid;
    }
}
```

- If `io-threads` is `>1`, real threads are spawned. Otherwise, the main thread alone handles I/O.
- Each thread has its own queue (`io_threads_list[i]`) and a lock.

**Enabling** in `redis.conf`:

```
io-threads 4
io-threads-do-reads yes
```

**`io-threads-do-reads yes`** means both read and write can be done in multiple threads. If `no`, only writes are multi-threaded.

---

## 9. Why Not a Full Multi-Reactor Approach?

**Memcached** and **Nginx** use a multi-reactor approach: each worker has its own event loop. For Redis, the single-threaded command execution model means the multi-reactor approach would require data locks or versioning of data (since each reactor could manipulate shared Redis structures). This conflicts with the “simplicity” principle and performance goals.

Hence, Redis 6.0 chooses a simpler approach:
- **One** event loop (the main thread).
- Extra threads *just* do the I/O read/write phases, under main-thread coordination.

---

## 10. Summary

Redis has evolved from a purely **single-threaded** network model to a **hybrid** approach:
- The **main thread** handles the event loop (accepting connections, dispatching tasks, command execution).
- **I/O threads** handle reading requests from client sockets into buffers and writing replies back to clients, in parallel.

**Key points**:
1. **Before 6.0**: The core network model was single-threaded (one reactor).  
2. **4.0** introduced background threads for big key deletion (UNLINK, FLUSHALL ASYNC).  
3. **6.0** introduced **I/O threading** for read/write parallelism, boosting performance on multi-core systems without rewriting the entire data structure logic to be thread-safe.  
4. Commands remain **single-threaded** → no lock overhead on data.  
5. Official recommended approach for heavy usage: also consider clustering or sharding across multiple Redis instances.
### 10.1 Will We See Full Multi-Threading in the Future?
Given the fundamental architecture of Redis, the current design is a compromise. A fully multi-threaded approach for all command processing would drastically complicate the codebase. As of now, the partial multi-thread approach is considered sufficient for most real-world use cases.
