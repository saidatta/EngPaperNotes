**Zero-copy** refers to a set of techniques and mechanisms by which data can be transferred from one location to another **without** (or with minimal) CPU-mediated copying. Typically, zero-copy helps **save CPU cycles** and **memory bandwidth** in high-throughput or large-data-transfer scenarios (e.g., network file transfers).

## 1. Overview of Zero-Copy

### Definition

> **Zero-copy**: “Computer operations in which the CPU does not perform the task of copying data from one memory area to another.”  
> — *Wikipedia*

In practice, “zero-copy” often means **avoiding or minimizing copies** in these critical paths:

1. **Kernel ↔ User** copies
2. **Kernel ↔ Kernel** copies (between different kernel buffers)
3. **User ↔ Hardware** communication, sometimes bypassing the kernel
4. **CPU-based** copies replaced by **DMA** (Direct Memory Access) or hardware scatter/gather

### Advantages

1. **Fewer CPU cycles** spent moving data.  
2. Reduced **context switching** between user mode and kernel mode.  
3. Less **cache pollution** (the CPU doesn’t load unneeded data).  
4. Possibility of **parallel** CPU work during DMA transfers.

### Categories of Zero-Copy Approaches

**(1) In-kernel data copying**  
- Goal: avoid user ↔ kernel copies.  
- The OS may copy data **entirely** inside the kernel or cleverly avoid kernel-buffer copies.  
- Example system calls: `mmap()`, `sendfile()`, `splice()`, and `copy_file_range()`.

**(2) Direct I/O bypassing the kernel**  
- User processes directly talk to hardware, with the kernel doing minimal management.  
- Data flows from hardware → user space without passing through the kernel’s page cache.  

**(3) Optimized CPU copies**  
- If a copy is inevitable, use techniques like **Copy-on-Write** or **buffer pools**.  
- Still uses user ↔ kernel paths, but tries to minimize overhead (fewer allocations, reusing buffers, etc.).

## 2. In-Kernel Data Copy

### 2.1 `mmap()`

#### What is `mmap()`?

```c
#include <sys/mman.h>

void *mmap(void *addr, size_t length, int prot, int flags, int fd, off_t offset);
int munmap(void *addr, size_t length);
```

- Maps a portion of a file (or device) **directly** into the process’s address space.
- Instead of reading a file into a user buffer, `mmap()` sets up page-table entries so that the file’s **kernel buffer** becomes a region in **user space**.  

#### How Does `mmap()` Reduce Copies?

- **Traditional I/O**:  
  - `read(fd, user_buf, size)` → CPU copies data from kernel page cache → user buffer.  
  - Then on `write()`, data is copied **again** from user buffer → kernel buffer.  
- **`mmap()` Flow**:
  1. **User** calls `mmap()` → user↔kernel context switch #1  
  2. **Kernel** sets up page tables, mapping the file’s kernel buffer pages into the process’s virtual address space.  
  3. **DMA** reads from disk → kernel buffer (no extra CPU copying to user space because the user can directly access these kernel buffer pages by virtue of mapping).  
  4. **User** calls `write()` → user↔kernel context switch #2  
  5. **CPU** copies data from these kernel-buffer pages to the **socket buffer** (for example).  
  6. **DMA** writes from socket buffer → network card.

**Result**:  
- We remove one full user↔kernel copy (since user space sees the kernel buffer directly).  
- Still have **2 DMA copies** (disk→kernel buffer, kernel buffer→NIC).  
- We do **1 CPU copy** from kernel buffer → socket buffer.  
- **Total copies** = 3 instead of 4.  
- **Context switches** remain 4 (two for `mmap()`, two for `write()`).

#### Caveats and Special Cases

1. **Cost of Memory Mapping**  
   - Changing page tables and flushing TLB entries can be expensive.  
   - Usually worthwhile for **large** or **long-lived** mappings.  
2. **File Truncation Issues**  
   - If another process **truncates** the file while it’s mapped, the accessing process can get a `SIGBUS` error.  
   - **Possible Solutions**:  
     - Handle `SIGBUS` in the application’s signal handler.  
     - Use **file lease locks** (on Linux) to be notified before truncation occurs.  
3. **Overheads**  
   - Although `mmap()` spares one CPU copy, it still does not remove the final CPU copy to the socket buffer.  

### 2.2 `sendfile()`

Introduced in **Linux 2.2**, `sendfile()` further **combines** the equivalent of `mmap()` + `write()` into **one** system call:

```c
#include <sys/sendfile.h>

ssize_t sendfile(int out_fd, int in_fd, off_t *offset, size_t count);
```

- **`in_fd`**: file descriptor from which data is read (regular file).  
- **`out_fd`**: typically a socket (pre-2.6.33) or any file descriptor (post-2.6.33).  
- **`offset`**: pointer to a file offset (updated as data is transferred).

#### Data Flow with `sendfile()`

1. **User** calls `sendfile()` → user↔kernel context switch #1  
2. **DMA**: disk → kernel buffer.  
3. **CPU** copies from kernel buffer → socket buffer.  
4. **DMA**: socket buffer → network card.  
5. Return to user space.

Hence:

- **2 DMA copies** + **1 CPU copy**.  
- **1** system call, so **2** context switches (enter kernel, exit kernel).  
- No data crosses user/kernel boundary for actual payload.  

#### Pros

1. **Even fewer** context switches than `mmap() + write()`.  
2. Data does **not** go into user space → **less overhead** in TLB or page table updates.  
3. User code is simpler:
   ```c
   // Example snippet
   #include <sys/sendfile.h>
   #include <fcntl.h>

   // Transfer up to 'count' bytes from in_fd to out_fd
   ssize_t transfer_data(int in_fd, int out_fd, off_t *offset, size_t count) {
       return sendfile(out_fd, in_fd, offset, count);
   }
   ```

#### File Truncation & Edge Cases

- Similar issues as with `mmap()`: if the file is truncated during send, the system call may be interrupted.  
- However, `sendfile()` internally handles partial reads more gracefully (returns number of bytes transferred).  
- Still doesn’t remove the **CPU copy** from kernel buffer → socket buffer.

#### Limitations

1. **Not standardized** across all Unix-like systems (though many do have equivalents).  
2. On the **receiver** side, there’s no direct `recvfile()` equivalent in mainstream Linux (though FreeBSD has `sendfile()` with a “trick” to handle receiving).  
3. Large files might require `sendfile64()` to handle 64-bit offsets.

### 2.3 `sendfile()` with DMA Scatter/Gather

> **Key idea**: If the hardware supports **scatter/gather** DMA, the CPU can skip copying to the socket buffer. Instead, the DMA controller can take data from multiple kernel memory segments to form network packets directly.

**Workflow**:

1. **User** calls `sendfile()` → context switch #1  
2. **Scatter**: DMA reads from disk → kernel buffer (which can be non-contiguous).  
3. **CPU** quickly updates a **buffer descriptor** (metadata of memory addresses) in the socket buffer.  
4. **Gather**: DMA fetches these addresses from the buffer descriptor, assembles a network packet, writes it **directly** to the network card.  
5. Return to user space → context switch #2.

**Result**:  
- The CPU copy of actual data (kernel buffer → socket buffer) is effectively **eliminated**.  
- Only a small metadata descriptor is copied by the CPU (very minimal overhead).  
- This approach significantly **reduces CPU cache pollution** and frees up CPU cycles.

## 3. Direct I/O Bypassing the Kernel

Another approach: let the user process directly talk to hardware with minimal kernel involvement. This can use special device drivers, e.g., `O_DIRECT` file accesses or RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) in specialized clusters.

- **Pros**: True zero-copy for user ↔ device.  
- **Cons**: Often requires advanced APIs, specialized hardware, or special driver support. Not suitable for all use cases.

---

## 4. Optimized Copy Paths

When full zero-copy is not feasible, partial solutions may help:

1. **Copy-on-Write (CoW)**  
   - If the data is not modified, skip physically copying it.  
2. **Buffer Pools**  
   - Reuse kernel buffers (often in network stacks), reducing allocations.  

These don’t eliminate the copy but can reduce overhead or memory churn.

## 5. Summary & Trade-Offs

### Big Picture of Zero-Copy

- **mmap()**:  
  - *Pros*: Reduces memory usage by mapping kernel buffer pages into user space directly, saves one CPU copy.  
  - *Cons*: Still has TLB flush overhead, potential SIGBUS on file truncation, extra system calls.  

- **sendfile()**:  
  - *Pros*: Minimizes context switches (only 1 system call), CPU overhead is lower, no user-kernel boundary crossing for data.  
  - *Cons*: Still typically 1 CPU copy, restricted to certain FD types, not standardized across all systems.  

- **sendfile() + DMA Scatter/Gather**:  
  - *Pros*: Avoids the final CPU copy by letting DMA assemble network packets.  
  - *Cons*: Requires hardware that supports scatter/gather, plus kernel driver support.  

- **Direct I/O**:  
  - *Pros*: Bypasses kernel buffering, can achieve near “pure” zero-copy.  
  - *Cons*: Complex, requires specialized hardware/driver support, not universal.  

### “No Silver Bullet”

Zero-copy techniques often have **specific** use cases:
- Large file transfers? **`sendfile()`** or **`mmap()`** might help.  
- Real-time streaming with special hardware? **Direct I/O** or **RDMA**.  
- Need partial control over the data in user space? Might still have to do at least one copy.  

In practice, **kernel developers** combine multiple strategies (e.g., `splice()`, `copy_file_range()`, driver-level scatter/gather) to reduce or remove copies.

3. **`sendfile()` + Scatter/Gather**: 2 data copies (all DMA) + minimal metadata from CPU.

## 7. Looking Ahead

Zero-copy is crucial for **high-performance** servers (e.g., web servers, media streaming, big data). Modern kernels continually refine zero-copy paths (see `splice()`, `vmsplice()`, `copy_file_range()`, etc.) to reduce overhead.  

**Next Steps**  
- Investigate **zero-copy** in **networking** stacks (e.g., [DPDK](https://www.dpdk.org/), [eBPF-based XDP](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/bpf/), or RDMA).  
- Explore **file systems** that leverage direct I/O for large sequential reads/writes.  
- Understand how user-mode libraries (like `sendfile`-based optimizations in **nginx**, **Apache**, etc.) use these features.
