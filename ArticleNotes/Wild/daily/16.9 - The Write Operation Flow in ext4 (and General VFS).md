This note describes the flow of **write** system calls in the Linux kernel I/O stack, focusing on **Buffered I/O** under the **ext4** file system as an example. It also explains the role of functions like `flush_dcache_page()`.

## 1. High-Level Path for `write(2)` Syscall

### 1.1 At the VFS Layer

Similar to **read**, the user calls:

```c
ssize_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count);
```
- Glibc’s wrapper → kernel `sys_write()` (macroed as `SYSCALL_DEFINE3(write,...)`).
- Internally calls `ksys_write()`, then `vfs_write()`:

```c
SYSCALL_DEFINE3(write, unsigned int, fd,
                const char __user *, buf, size_t, count)
{
    return ksys_write(fd, buf, count);
}

ssize_t ksys_write(unsigned int fd, const char __user *buf, size_t count)
{
    ...
    ret = vfs_write(f.file, buf, count, ppos);
    ...
}
```

### 1.2 `vfs_write()`

```c
ssize_t vfs_write(struct file *file, const char __user *buf,
                  size_t count, loff_t *pos)
{
    if (file->f_op->write)
        ret = file->f_op->write(file, buf, count, pos);
    else if (file->f_op->write_iter)
        ret = new_sync_write(file, buf, count, pos);
    else
        ret = -EINVAL;
    ...
}
```

- Many modern filesystems do not implement `write`, but implement `write_iter`. So typically, the kernel calls **`new_sync_write()`** if `f_op->write_iter` is set.

### 1.3 In ext4

The ext4 file operations are:

```c
const struct file_operations ext4_file_operations = {
    .read_iter   = ext4_file_read_iter,
    .write_iter  = ext4_file_write_iter,
    /* ... */
};
```

Hence, the kernel calls `ext4_file_write_iter()`:

```c
static ssize_t ext4_file_write_iter(struct kiocb *iocb, struct iov_iter *from)
{
    if (iocb->ki_flags & IOCB_DIRECT)
        return ext4_dio_write_iter(iocb, from);
    else
        return ext4_buffered_write_iter(iocb, from);
}
```

**We focus on Buffered I/O**. For Direct I/O, it bypasses page cache. Here’s the path for the common buffered case:

---

## 2. `ext4_buffered_write_iter()`

```c
static ssize_t ext4_buffered_write_iter(struct kiocb *iocb,
                                        struct iov_iter *from)
{
    ssize_t ret;
    struct inode *inode = file_inode(iocb->ki_filp);

    if (iocb->ki_flags & IOCB_NOWAIT)
        return -EOPNOTSUPP;

    /* Acquire inode lock for serialization */
    inode_lock(inode);

    ret = ext4_write_checks(iocb, from);
    if (ret <= 0)
        goto out;

    // The core writing logic:
    ret = generic_perform_write(iocb, from);

out:
    inode_unlock(inode);
    if (unlikely(ret <= 0))
        return ret;

    /* Possibly sync metadata if O_SYNC / O_DSYNC, etc. */
    return generic_write_sync(iocb, ret);
}
```

**Key**:  
1. `ext4_write_checks()` might do file size checks, journaling checks, etc.  
2. `generic_perform_write()` does the actual buffered write to page cache.  
3. `generic_write_sync()` does an immediate sync if the file or I/O flags have `O_SYNC`/`O_DSYNC`.

---

## 3. `generic_perform_write()`

```c
ssize_t generic_perform_write(struct kiocb *iocb, struct iov_iter *i)
{
    struct file *file = iocb->ki_filp;
    struct address_space *mapping = file->f_mapping;
    const struct address_space_operations *a_ops = mapping->a_ops;
    loff_t pos = iocb->ki_pos;

    ssize_t written = 0;
    long status = 0;

    do {
        /* figure out offset in page, how many bytes remain in user’s buffer */
        offset = (pos & (PAGE_SIZE - 1));
        bytes = min_t(unsigned long, PAGE_SIZE - offset,
                                       iov_iter_count(i));

        /* 1) Prepare the page: */
        status = a_ops->write_begin(file, mapping, pos, bytes, &page, &fsdata);
        if (unlikely(status < 0))
            break;

        // If page is mapped by a process, handle aliasing:
        if (mapping_writably_mapped(mapping))
            flush_dcache_page(page);

        /* 2) Copy data from user space to the page in page cache: */
        copied = copy_page_from_iter_atomic(page, offset, bytes, i);
        flush_dcache_page(page);

        /* 3) Notify FS that we’re done:  */
        status = a_ops->write_end(file, mapping, pos, bytes, copied,
                                  page, fsdata);
        if (unlikely(status != copied)) {
            iov_iter_revert(i, copied - max(status, 0L));
            if (unlikely(status < 0))
                break;
        }

        pos += status;
        written += status;

        balance_dirty_pages_ratelimited(mapping);

    } while (iov_iter_count(i));
    ...
    iocb->ki_pos += written;
    return written ? written : status;
}
```

**Key Steps**:

1. **`a_ops->write_begin`**  
   - FS can allocate blocks, do journaling, or set up an appropriate page. For ext4, that’s `ext4_write_begin()`.
2. **`flush_dcache_page()`**  
   - If the mapped memory is being written from the CPU’s perspective, ensure CPU cache lines remain coherent. (We discuss it in detail below.)
3. **`copy_page_from_iter_atomic()`**  
   - Copies user-space buffer into the page. 
4. Another **`flush_dcache_page()`** after copying.
5. **`a_ops->write_end`**  
   - The FS finalizes the new data, sets the page as dirty, and updates any inode info.
6. Possibly calls **`balance_dirty_pages_ratelimited()`** to throttle if too many dirty pages exist.
7. The function returns the number of bytes written to the page cache. The actual disk flush is **not** done here (it’s asynchronous). Only if `O_SYNC` or other synchronous flags exist, `generic_write_sync()` triggers a forced flush to disk.

---

## 4. The `flush_dcache_page()` Mystery

We see **`flush_dcache_page()`** called before & after copying data from user-space. Similar calls appear in read paths as well (`flush_dcache_folio()`).

### 4.1 CPU Cache & Virtual Aliasing

To clarify:

- Modern CPUs have multiple layers of cache: L1, L2, L3. The **D-cache** (Data cache) is relevant for read/write ops on memory. 
- With **virtual memory**, an address can be mapped to physical memory frames. Sometimes multiple different virtual addresses map to the same physical frame → “virtual aliasing.” 
- Without careful coherence, one alias might hold stale data or incorrectly override new data.

**`flush_dcache_page(page)`** ensures that if the user program or the kernel is writing to that page (via different addresses or different mappings), the CPU’s data cache lines are consistent. For instance:
- On read path, if user data is updated in the kernel page, we might need to flush or invalidate old cache lines in other aliases. 
- On write path, we do a flush before copying user data in, ensuring we don’t load stale lines, and flush after copying to ensure new data is visible if another alias is used by, say, device or direct mapping.

### 4.2 Implementations

**`flush_dcache_page()`** is architecture-dependent. On x86, with a coherent cache design, it might be a no-op. On others (ARM, MIPS, etc.), it can do real hardware instructions (like `dcbst`, `icbi`, etc.). 

Hence, we see these calls in read & write code to accommodate non-coherent architectures or weird memory aliasing scenarios.

## 5. Summary of the Write Flow

**In short**:

1. `sys_write()` → `vfs_write()` → `f_op->write_iter` → `ext4_file_write_iter()`.
2. If `Direct I/O`, do `ext4_dio_write_iter()`. Otherwise, do `ext4_buffered_write_iter()`.
3. `ext4_buffered_write_iter()` calls `generic_perform_write()`, which:
   - Invokes `a_ops->write_begin()` (e.g. `ext4_write_begin()`) to do FS block setup.
   - Potentially calls `flush_dcache_page()` to ensure cache coherence.
   - Copies data from user space into the page cache.
   - Another `flush_dcache_page()` after.
   - Calls `a_ops->write_end()` to finalize the page as dirty. 
   - Possibly throttles via `balance_dirty_pages_ratelimited()`.
4. Return to user space. The data is “written” but actually only in **page cache** marked as dirty. The kernel’s **writeback** eventually flushes dirty data to the disk. 
5. If file is `O_SYNC` or other flags, `generic_write_sync()` triggers an immediate flush to disk.

**Hence** the “mystery” of `flush_dcache_page()`: dealing with CPU caching & aliasing. The actual disk write is asynchronous except for certain sync flags.
