## 1. Overview

The **Virtual File System (VFS)** in Linux is designed using object-oriented (OOP) ideas in C. Various core data structures (superblock, inode, dentry, file) act like “objects,” containing both **state** (fields) and **behavior** (function pointers). The actual file system (ext4, xfs, etc.) provides implementations of these function callbacks. This OOP-like design allows VFS to be a unified abstraction layer for many different file systems.

This document focuses on:

1. **superblock**: Represents a mounted file system instance.  
2. **inode**: Represents an individual file (or directory, device, etc.) with metadata.  
3. **dentry**: Represents a directory entry (a path component).  
4. **file**: Represents an open file in a process.

## 2. superblock

### 2.1 The `super_block` Structure

Defined in `<include/linux/fs.h>`, the `super_block` represents a **mounted** file system:

```c
struct super_block {
	struct list_head s_list;         // Linked list of superblocks of same fs type
	dev_t s_dev;                     // Device identifier
	unsigned long s_blocksize;       // Block size (bytes)
	loff_t s_maxbytes;               // Max file size
	struct file_system_type *s_type; // FS type (name, properties)
	const struct super_operations *s_op; // Superblock ops
	uuid_t s_uuid;                   // Unique FS identifier
	struct list_head s_inodes;       // List of all inodes in this fs
	unsigned long s_magic;           // FS "magic" number
	struct dentry *s_root;           // Root dentry
	int s_count;                     // superblock refcount
	void *s_fs_info;                 // FS-specific data
	const struct dentry_operations *s_d_op; // default dentry ops
	...
};
```

Notable fields:
- **s_root**: The root `dentry` of this file system.  
- **s_op**: Points to `super_operations` that define how to do superblock-level tasks (e.g. sync, write, statfs).  
- **s_inodes**: List of inodes belonging to this file system.  

#### 2.1.1 `super_operations`

```c
struct super_operations {
	struct inode *(*alloc_inode)(struct super_block *sb);
	void (*destroy_inode)(struct inode *);
	void (*free_inode)(struct inode *);
	void (*dirty_inode)(struct inode *, int flags);
	int  (*write_inode)(struct inode *, struct writeback_control *wbc);
	int  (*drop_inode)(struct inode *);
	void (*evict_inode)(struct inode *);
	void (*put_super)(struct super_block *);
	int  (*sync_fs)(struct super_block *sb, int wait);
	...
	int  (*statfs)(struct dentry *, struct kstatfs *);
	int  (*remount_fs)(struct super_block *, int *, char *);
	void (*umount_begin)(struct super_block *);
	...
};
```

This table defines kernel-callback function pointers that handle global or FS-level tasks such as:

- `write_inode()`: Persist an inode to disk.  
- `sync_fs()`: Sync entire file system.  
- `statfs()`: Get filesystem statistics.  

**Note**: Some older fields like `write_super()` existed historically but have been removed in newer kernels. The concept remains similar though.

## 3. Inode

### 3.1 The `inode` Structure

An **inode** is an object representing a file, directory, device node, or other entity in a file system. The structure is in `<include/linux/fs.h>`:

```c
struct inode {
	umode_t i_mode;                      // File mode/permissions
	kuid_t  i_uid;                       // Owner UID
	kgid_t  i_gid;                       // Owner GID
	unsigned int i_flags;               // FS-specific flags
	const struct inode_operations *i_op; // Inode ops
	struct super_block *i_sb;           // Parent superblock
	struct address_space *i_mapping;    // Associated address space
	unsigned long i_ino;                // Inode number
	unsigned int i_nlink;               // Hard link count
	dev_t i_rdev;                       // Device ID if special file
	loff_t i_size;                      // File size in bytes
	struct timespec64 i_atime;          // Last access time
	struct timespec64 i_mtime;          // Last modification time
	struct timespec64 i_ctime;          // Creation/change time
	unsigned short i_bytes;             // Bytes in use
	const struct file_operations *i_fop;// File ops for open files
	struct address_space i_data;        // Device's address mapping
	...
};
```

Key fields:
- **i_sb**: Points back to the `super_block`.  
- **i_op**: A pointer to `inode_operations`.  
- **i_fop**: A pointer to `file_operations` used when a file is opened.  

### 3.2 `inode_operations`

```c
struct inode_operations {
	struct dentry * (*lookup)(struct inode *, struct dentry *, unsigned int);
	int (*create)(struct mnt_idmap *, struct inode *,struct dentry *, umode_t, bool);
	int (*link)(struct dentry *,struct inode *,struct dentry *);
	int (*unlink)(struct inode *,struct dentry *);
	int (*mkdir)(struct mnt_idmap *, struct inode *,struct dentry *, umode_t);
	int (*rmdir)(struct inode *,struct dentry *);
	int (*mknod)(struct mnt_idmap *, struct inode *,struct dentry *, umode_t, dev_t);
	int (*rename)(struct mnt_idmap *, struct inode *, struct dentry *,
		      struct inode *, struct dentry *, unsigned int);
	int (*setattr)(struct mnt_idmap *, struct dentry *, struct iattr *);
	int (*getattr)(struct mnt_idmap *, const struct path *, struct kstat *,
		           u32, unsigned int);
	...
};
```

**inode_operations** define the FS-specific logic for:
- `create()`, `unlink()`, `rename()`, etc.  
- This is how VFS calls into the actual filesystem for file-level changes.

---

## 4. Dentry & Dcache

### 4.1 Dentry Concept
**Dentry** (“directory entry”) objects represent **path components**. For example, in `/bin/vi`, you have separate dentries for `/`, `bin`, and `vi`. Each `dentry` links to an **inode** (`d_inode`), but a single inode can have multiple dentries (hard links).

```c
struct dentry {
	unsigned int d_flags;
	struct dentry *d_parent;     // parent directory entry
	struct qstr d_name;          // the name (component) for this dentry
	struct inode *d_inode;       // pointer to inode (may be NULL for negative)
	const struct dentry_operations *d_op;
	struct super_block *d_sb;    // associated superblock
	void *d_fsdata;              // fs-specific data
	/* plus internal fields for LRU, hash, children, etc. */
};
```

### 4.2 `dentry_operations`
```c
struct dentry_operations {
	int (*d_revalidate)(struct dentry *, unsigned int);
	int (*d_hash)(const struct dentry *, struct qstr *);
	int (*d_compare)(const struct dentry *,
	                 unsigned int, const char *, const struct qstr *);
	int (*d_delete)(const struct dentry *);
	...
};
```

Allows a file system to define how to:
- Validate a dentry,
- Compare names,
- Possibly handle hashing for a path component,
- Manage negative dentries, etc.

### 4.3 Dcache
**Dcache** is the caching mechanism for directory entries to speed up path lookups. A path-based lookup can be expensive if it has to parse each component from scratch. With dcache:

- **in-use** dentry: Mapped to a valid inode, reference count > 0.  
- **unused** dentry: Has valid inode but refcount = 0. Kernel might keep it in dcache in case it’s used again (subject to memory pressure).  
- **negative** dentry: No inode (i.e. `d_inode == NULL`), meaning “path not found.” This is also cached to speed up repeated lookups for missing files.

Dcache organizes dentries in:
1. A **hash table** for fast path -> dentry lookups.  
2. An **LRU list** for “unused” or “negative” entries to quickly reclaim.  
3. A per-inode list for all dentries referencing that inode.

---

## 5. Conclusion

**VFS** uses these data structures and operation tables (`super_operations`, `inode_operations`, `dentry_operations`, `file_operations`) to unify different file systems behind a single kernel interface. The `super_block` object describes a specific mounted file system, the `inode` object represents file metadata, the `dentry` object represents a path component, and the `file` object describes an open file for a user process.

**Why** OOP-like approach in C? Because it’s essential to have a flexible interface so that each real filesystem can implement its own version of these method tables, while the kernel-level code just calls the function pointers.

The combination of inodes, dentries, and file structures, plus the caching (dcache), yields a powerful, modular design.
