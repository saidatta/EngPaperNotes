## Overview
Distributed transactions are a **key aspect** of modern distributed systems. Once an application’s data is **distributed** across multiple nodes/databases, ensuring *transactional atomicity, consistency, and durability* across nodes is non-trivial. This article dives deeply into:
1. **Transaction basics** (ACID vs. BASE)
2. **Rigid vs. Flexible Transactions**  
3. **Local vs. Distributed Transactions**  
4. **Atomic Commit Protocols** (1PC, 2PC, 3PC)  
5. **XA interface standard**  
6. **Concurrency Control**  
7. **Recovery**  
By understanding these building blocks, you can see how distributed transactions maintain atomicity across multiple server nodes and how advanced protocols (Paxos, Multi-Paxos, Raft) also come into play in distributed consensus.

## 1. Transactions
### 1.1 Definition
A **transaction** is a program execution unit that:
- *Accesses and possibly updates data items.*
- *Consists of multiple steps*, typically bounded by `begin transaction` and `end transaction`.
- **Atomic**: either all steps succeed or none do (rollback).

### 1.2 ACID

1. **Atomicity**: Indivisible – all steps succeed or none.  
2. **Consistency**: Moves the system from one valid state to another.  
3. **Isolation**: Parallel transactions don’t interfere (serializable if fully enforced).  
4. **Durability**: Once committed, changes persist even upon failures.

**Rigid transactions** in single databases respect full ACID.

## 2. Rigid vs. Flexible Transactions

### 2.1 Rigid Transactions
- Fully ACID, also known as **CP** transactions in CAP theory.
- Local DB transactions are typically rigid: single-node, single-database scope.
- Ensure strong consistency but can be expensive in distributed settings (locking, blocking, limited concurrency).

### 2.2 Flexible Transactions
- Stemming from **BASE** principle:
  - **Basically Available**: The system can degrade but remains operational.
  - **Soft-state**: Some data can be stale, partial updates allowed.
  - **Eventual consistency**: Over time, the system converges to consistency.
- CAP tradeoffs: relaxing strong consistency for higher availability and performance.
- Widely used in microservices, e-commerce, distributed caching, etc.

**In practice**: Many distributed systems employ flexible transactions (like Saga, TCC) that offer eventual or relaxed consistency.

## 3. Local vs. Distributed Transactions

### 3.1 Local Transactions
- **Single database**/node resource object.
- Full ACID constraints in a single DB system – no distribution needed.

### 3.2 Distributed Transactions
- A single “global” transaction spans multiple nodes or database resource objects.
- Must ensure **atomic** results across all involved nodes → “all commit or all rollback.”
- New complexities:
  1. *Commit/rollback decision* among multiple servers.
  2. *Concurrency control* across multiple resource managers, possibly leading to distributed deadlocks.

**Solution**: Typically, a **coordinator** orchestrates commit/abort. Protocols like **2PC** or **3PC** handle atomic commit. Concurrency control might be distributed locks, timestamps, or advanced algorithms like multi-version concurrency across nodes.

---

## 4. Atomic Commit Protocols

**Definition**: An **atomic commit protocol** ensures that, at transaction end, all nodes either commit or abort.  

### 4.1 1PC (Single-Phase) Commit
- Simplest approach: The coordinator sends “commit” to all participants. 
- **No** participant can veto. So, if a node fails or must roll back, the coordinator is unaware → leads to inconsistencies.
- Not practical for real distributed transactions needing a participant’s ability to unilaterally abort if local errors occur.

---

## 5. Two-Phase Commit (2PC)

### 5.1 Definition
**2PC** addresses the inability of participants to abort in 1PC. It introduces a *coordinator* that polls each participant’s readiness in **two** phases:

**Phases**:
1. **Prepare Phase** (Voting):
   - Participants execute local transaction steps, then record a `<ready T>` log if they succeed.
   - Participants respond “YES” (ready) or “NO” (can’t commit) to the coordinator.
2. **Commit/Abort Phase**:
   - If *all* votes = “YES,” the coordinator logs `<commit T>` and broadcasts “doCommit.”
   - Otherwise, it logs `<abort T>` and broadcasts “doAbort.”
   - Participants upon receiving “doCommit” or “doAbort” finalize local transaction (commit or rollback).

    P2->>Coord: Yes/No
    alt All Yes
        Coord->>P1: doCommit
        Coord->>P2: doCommit
        P1->>Coord: ack
        P2->>Coord: ack
    else At least one No
        Coord->>P1: doAbort
        Coord->>P2: doAbort
    end
```

### 5.2 Performance
**Network**:
- 4 message “hops” in the simplest description:
  1. Participants → coordinator (ready),
  2. coordinator → participants (canCommit),
  3. participants → coordinator (yes/no),
  4. coordinator → participants (doCommit/doAbort).
- In practice, if the coordinator is also the transaction initiator, 3 message rounds are typical.

**Disk I/O**:
- Each participant logs `<ready T>` when local transaction done.
- Coordinator logs `<prepare T>` or `<commit T>` etc.
- Typically N+1 disk writes for N participants.

### 5.3 Recovery
- If a participant’s last log record is `<ready T>` upon crash, it must contact others after restart to see final commit or abort outcome.
- If coordinator crashed, participants remain blocked if no other mechanism is used. (Hence single point failure risk.)

### 5.4 Drawbacks
1. **Synchronous blocking**: Participants lock resources until final commit/abort, can block concurrency.
2. **Single point of failure**: Coordinator crash can block participants indefinitely.
3. **Possible data inconsistency**: If coordinator partially sends “commit” and fails, some participants see “commit,” others do not → inconsistency.

### 5.5 XA Standard Interface
- 2PC is conceptually abstract. **XA** standardizes it:
  - **TM** (Transaction Manager),
  - **RM** (Resource Manager, e.g., DB),
  - **AP** (Application).  
- Most DB vendors implement **XA** for distributed transactions.  
- In Java, **JTA** is the interface for XA-based transactions.

## 6. Three-Phase Commit (3PC)

### 6.1 Motivation
2PC can block if the coordinator fails. 3PC tries to reduce blocking by:
- Splitting the **1st** phase of 2PC into two steps, adding a **“CanCommit”** step before actual prepare/lock.
- Introducing **timeouts** → if coordinator or participant fails, they can unilaterally decide based on partial knowledge.

**Phases**:
1. **CanCommit**: Coordinator sends “can we commit?” to participants. They do *not* lock or finalize, only check feasibility. They reply “YES”/“NO.”
2. **PreCommit**: If all “YES,” coordinator instructs participants to “prepare” (local transaction done, record undo/redo logs, but do not commit). If any “NO,” coordinator instructs “abort.”  
3. **DoCommit**: If all participants ack “prepared,” coordinator sends “commit.” If a node or coordinator times out, certain fallback rules apply (some participants might commit if they suspect the coordinator decided commit, etc.).

### 6.2 Differences vs. 2PC
- Tries to avoid indefinite blocking by using timeouts. 
- If coordinator partially fails in final phase, some participants can commit after timeout. 
- However, it still may lead to data inconsistency if network partitions occur (some nodes never see “abort” message).
- Rarely used in practice due to higher complexity and assumption that you can “time out” safely.

## 7. Summary

**Distributed Transactions** ensure atomic commits across multiple resources in a distributed system. Two fundamental protocols:
- **2PC**: Widely implemented (XA, JTA). Simple, but can block if coordinator fails.  
- **3PC**: Attempts to solve 2PC’s blocking but introduces complexity, potential for data inconsistency in partial partitions.

**Rigid Transactions** → ACID, single-DB or 2PC.  
**Flexible Transactions** → BASE, eventual consistency, e.g., saga patterns, TCC, etc.

### Key Points
1. **Atomic** commits across multiple nodes → coordinator-based protocols.  
2. **2PC** is the de facto standard (XA) but has blocking and single-point-of-failure issues.  
3. **3PC** tries to fix the blocking but is not widely used in production.  
4. For large-scale systems, often **BASE** approaches or consensus-based protocols (like Paxos/Raft) used for replication and partial ordering.

**Forthcoming**: deeper dives into concurrency control (distributed locking, MVCC in distributed systems), Paxos/Multi-Paxos, Raft, etc., to maintain overall consistency.
