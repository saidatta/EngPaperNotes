WarpStream offers a streamlined, Kafka-compatible distributed system that eases the deployment and operational burden of running Kafka. It achieves this by leveraging **stateless agents** that communicate directly with **object storage** (like Amazon S3) and a **cloud metadata store**. This design enables scalability, cost efficiency, and reduced operational complexity.

WarpStream’s architecture revolves around **three key design principles**:
1. **Separation of storage and compute**
2. **Separation of data from metadata**
3. **Separation of the data plane from the control plane**
---
### **Architecture Components**

#### **1. WarpStream Agents**
- **Stateless and Kafka-compatible** binaries running within the customer’s cloud.
- Agents handle the Kafka protocol, acting as the leader for any topic, committing offsets, and coordinating the cluster without needing stateful storage.
- **Deployment flexibility**: WarpStream Agents can be scaled up or down based on **CPU usage** or **network bandwidth**, making auto-scaling straightforward.
- **Communication model**:
  - Data flows directly from agents to object storage.
  - Metadata operations are managed through WarpStream’s **control plane**.

##### **Agent Implementation Example (Pseudocode)**
```python
class WarpStreamAgent:
    def produce(self, topic, message):
        # Batches incoming messages for multiple topics and partitions
        batch = self.batch_message(topic, message)
        # Writes batch to object storage
        file_id = self.write_to_object_storage(batch)
        # Commits metadata to control plane
        self.commit_metadata(file_id)
        return "ACK"
```

#### **2. Separation of Storage and Compute**
- **Decoupling storage from compute** enables dynamic scaling, faster recovery from failures, and eliminates data ownership by any specific node.
- Storage is handled by **cloud object storage**, such as S3, while compute is managed by WarpStream Agents, which can process data from any file.
- Benefits:
  - **Hotspot elimination**: Since agents don’t own specific partitions, load distribution is more even.
  - **Faster failover**: Agents can take over operations without rebalance delays.

##### **ASCII Visualization**
```ascii
+-----------+      +------------------+      +---------------+
| Producer  | ---> | WarpStream Agent | ---> | Object Storage|
+-----------+      +------------------+      +---------------+
```

#### **3. Separation of Data from Metadata**
- **Data** is stored in object storage, while **metadata** is managed by a cloud metadata store.
- This decoupling ensures that **data remains within the customer’s VPC**, providing security and privacy.
- Metadata operations include managing topic-partition mappings, file offsets, and other control plane functions.
- WarpStream’s metadata store is inspired by **FoundationDB**, designed for strong consistency and high throughput.

##### **Metadata Commit Example (Pseudocode)**
```python
class MetadataStore:
    def commit_file_metadata(self, file_id, topic, offset_range):
        # Writes metadata for the file to the control plane
        self.write_to_journal(file_id, topic, offset_range)
        return "COMMITTED"
```

#### **4. Separation of Data Plane from Control Plane**
- The **data plane** consists of WarpStream Agents operating in the customer's VPC, handling Kafka protocol requests.
- The **control plane** runs in WarpStream’s cloud, handling tasks like data compaction, cache management, and retention management.
- This design offloads hard problems like **consensus and coordination** from the customer to WarpStream’s managed control plane.

##### **Control Plane Functions**
1. **Data Compaction**: Agents periodically merge small files into larger files to improve read efficiency and reduce costs.
2. **Zone-aware caching**: Agents manage an in-memory, distributed cache to serve hot data with low latency.
3. **Retention management**: Agents scan object storage for expired files, reducing storage costs.

### **WarpStream vs. Traditional Tiered Storage**
Unlike traditional **tiered storage solutions** in Kafka, WarpStream achieves complete decoupling:
- **Stateless agents** handle both reads and writes, with no need for local disks.
- **Data streams directly** to object storage without inter-AZ replication, significantly reducing costs.

##### **Cost Efficiency Calculation**
Given the cost of inter-zone networking (~$0.05/GB) and the cost of S3 storage (~$0.02/GB):
```equation
Cost_{inter\_zone} = 0.05/GB \\
Cost_{object\_storage} = 0.02/GB
```
WarpStream’s direct-to-S3 architecture avoids the inter-zone costs, making it **2.5x cheaper** over the same period.

### **Detailed Components**

#### **1. Virtual Cluster**
- Each WarpStream deployment has one or more **Virtual Clusters**, representing isolated, fully independent clusters within a customer’s VPC.
- A Virtual Cluster is a **replicated state machine** that tracks topic-partition metadata and offsets.
- It provides **atomic Kafka operations** (e.g., producing to multiple topics/partitions).
- Metadata operations are journaled to a **strongly consistent log storage system** before being executed by a Virtual Cluster replica.

##### **Virtual Cluster Implementation Example (Pseudocode)**
```python
class VirtualCluster:
    def produce(self, topic, partition, message):
        file_id = self.write_to_object_storage(topic, partition, message)
        metadata = self.create_metadata_entry(file_id, topic, partition)
        self.metadata_store.commit(metadata)
        return "ACK"
```

#### **2. Cloud Services Layer**
- Manages the lifecycle of Virtual Clusters, ensuring **high availability** and **automatic failover**.
- It backs up metadata to object storage and **replays logs** to create replacement replicas without manual intervention.
- Also powers WarpStream’s **admin console** and **observability dashboard**.

##### **Cloud Services Functionality**
- **Automatic backup**: Ensures metadata durability by periodically backing up Virtual Cluster states.
- **Load balancing**: Dynamically allocates agents to balance read and write loads.
- **Multi-region isolation**: Each region operates independently to ensure compliance and reduce latency.

### **Performance and Cost Optimization**

#### **Efficient Storage Design**
- WarpStream Agents batch messages from multiple topics/partitions into larger files, minimizing **S3 PUT/GET costs**.
- Background compaction further consolidates files to improve read efficiency.
- This approach balances cost and latency, achieving **real-time Kafka performance** with reduced operational overhead.

##### **Cost Optimization Equation**
```equation
Total\_cost = (num\_puts + num\_gets) * cost_{IO} + storage_{cost}
```
Where:
- **num_puts** and **num_gets**: Number of PUT/GET requests.
- **cost_{IO}**: Cost of IO operations.
- **storage_{cost}**: Cost of storing data in object storage.

#### **Latency Metrics**
- **Producer to Consumer P99 Latency**: Typically around **1 second**.
- **Producer Acknowledgment Latency**: Approximately **400-500 ms**.
- By using **S3 Express One Zone** for faster writes, WarpStream can achieve **sub-150 ms latency** for critical workloads.

##### **Latency Reduction Strategy**
- Writes initially land in low-latency storage, then compactions move them to cheaper, standard storage.
- This tiered object storage allows for optimized cost while maintaining performance.

### **Use Cases and Applications**

#### **1. Real-time Analytics**
- Supports analytics workloads where **low latency** and **high throughput** are critical.
- Ideal for use cases like **financial data processing**, **IoT telemetry**, and **log aggregation**.

#### **2. High-Throughput Event Streaming**
- Handles large-scale event streams with **thousands of partitions**, making it suitable for **ad tech platforms** and **social media streaming**.

#### **3. Long-term Data Retention**
- Uses tiered object storage for cost-effective long-term retention while ensuring data remains **readily accessible**.

##### **Example Tiered Storage Configuration**
```json
{
  "tieredStorageConfig": {
    "lowLatency": {
      "type": "S3_Express",
      "bucket": "low-latency-bucket"
    },
    "highLatency": {
      "type": "S3_Standard",
      "bucket": "high-latency-bucket"
    }
  }
}
```
