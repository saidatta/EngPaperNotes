## Overview

The main idea revolves around identifying your passion and leveraging it to do great work. It emphasizes the necessity of innate aptitude, deep interest, and opportunities to perform remarkable work.

## Key Steps

1. **Finding Aptitude & Interest**: Find something you are naturally good at and have a deep interest in. This could be challenging, especially when you're young or when the type of work you end up doing doesn't exist yet. Guessing and trial and error might be necessary. 
    - **Tag:** #Career_Path #Passion #Aptitude #Interest
    
2. **Working on Projects**: Develop a habit of working on your own projects. The projects should be what you find excitingly ambitious. As your taste evolves, the exciting and important converge. Maintaining the sense of excited curiosity is vital; it drives you and shows what to work on. 
    - **Tag:** #Projects #Curiosity #Ambition
    
3. **Identifying Curiosity**: The key is to find what you are excessively curious about to a degree that would bore most other people. That's where your passion lies.

# Navigating Career Choices and Ambitions

## Overview
The section discusses the challenges of determining what to work on due to the uncertain nature of ambition and the flaws in the educational system. It offers advice on navigating these challenges, emphasizing the importance of curiosity and genuine interest.

## Key Concepts

1.  **Complexity of Choosing Work**: Choosing a field to work on can be complex due to overlapping steps and insufficient information. You may need to work in a field for years before understanding if it suits you or not.
    -   **Tag**: #Career_Choices #Decision_Making #Work
2.  **Nature of Ambition**: Ambition comes in two forms - one that precedes interest and one that grows out of it. The former can make decision-making harder.
    -   **Tag**: #Ambition #Interest #Motivation
3.  **Flaws in the Educational System**: The educational system often requires committing to a field prematurely, leaving ambitious individuals on suboptimal trajectories. When it comes to career choices, individuals are often left to figure it out on their own.
    -   **Tag**: #Education #Career_Path #System_Flaws
4.  **Role of Curiosity and Luck**: Biographies of successful individuals often highlight the role of curiosity and luck. To attract luck, one should be curious, try many things, meet many people, read a lot, and ask many questions.
    -   **Tag**: #Luck #Curiosity #Success
5.  **Optimizing for Interestingness**: One should give different types of work a chance and select fields that become increasingly interesting as you learn more about them. Unusual tastes often lead to productivity and discovery of new things.
    -   **Tag**: #Interestingness #Career_Choice #Discovery
6.  **Lack of Loyalty to Fields**: One does not owe any loyalty to a field. If a more exciting field is discovered, switching should not be feared.
    -   **Tag**: #Career_Switch #Loyalty #Change
7.  **Creating for the Audience**: If creating something for people, ensure it's something they want. The best strategy is to make something that you yourself want, which also forms your initial audience.
    -   **Tag**: #Audience #Creation #Product_Design
8.  **Sticking to Genuine Interests**: Genuine interest serves as a compass against distractions. If you're interested, you're not astray.

# Strategies for Effective Work and Overcoming Procrastination

## Overview
This section explores the importance of boldness and not over-planning when following interests. It also addresses the challenges of maintaining consistent work effort and strategies for overcoming procrastination on a daily and project level.

## Key Concepts
1.  **Following Interests Requires Boldness**: Following interests often involves facing obstacles, risking rejection and failure. Therefore, it requires a considerable amount of boldness.
    -   **Tag**: #Career_Path #Boldness #Risk_Taking
2.  **Planning vs Preserving Invariants**: Over-planning might be ineffective for achievements not describable in advance. Work hard on excitingly ambitious projects and preserve certain invariants, instead of following a detailed plan.
    -   **Tag**: #Planning #Work_Strategy #Achievement
3.  **Staying Upwind Strategy**: This approach involves doing what's most interesting at each stage and what provides the best options for the future, rather than planning in great detail.
    -   **Tag**: #Career_Strategy #Staying_Upwind #Flexibility
4.  **Working Techniques**: Working is not always straightforward, and it requires techniques like avoiding overwork, ensuring contiguous work hours, overcoming the initial threshold, and finishing what you start.
    -   **Tag**: #Work_Techniques #Productivity #Time_Management
5.  **Permissible Self-Deception**: Occasional self-deception, like underestimating project work, exaggerating the importance of the work, or tricking oneself into starting, can be beneficial in doing great work.
    -   **Tag**: #Self_Deception #Motivation #Work_Strategy
6.  **Two Forms of Procrastination**: There are daily procrastination (avoiding starting work) and project-level procrastination (delaying ambitious projects). The latter is more dangerous and can be overcome by regularly questioning if one is working on what they most want to.
    -   **Tag**: #Procrastination #Work_Ethic #Time_Management

# Understanding the Nature of Great Work and Cultivating Individual Style

## Overview
This section delves into the nature of great work, highlighting the importance of consistent effort, exponential growth, undirected thinking, aiming for the best, and cultivating a distinctive style.

## Key Concepts
1.  **Consistency and Cumulative Effect in Work**: Great work often entails investing significant time into a problem. The key is consistent effort, even if it's small, which can result in exponential growth over time.
    -   **Tag**: #Consistency #Exponential_Growth #Work_Ethic
2.  **Undervaluing Exponential Growth**: People tend to underrate exponential growth in its early stages, overlooking the value of pushing through initial, unrewarding phases to eventually achieve extraordinary results.
    -   **Tag**: #Exponential_Growth #Long_term_Investment #Perseverance
3.  **Undirected Thinking**: Occasional wandering of the mind, interspersed with dedicated work, can often help solve problems. However, it's important to avoid distractions during this undirected thinking to ensure it's used effectively.
    -   **Tag**: #Undirected_Thinking #Creativity #Problem_Solving
4.  **Importance of High Aims**: Aiming to be the best, rather than just good, is critical. Ambition to be the best is a qualitatively different thing from ambition to be good. It can be surprisingly liberating and simplifies the focus.
    -   **Tag**: #Aiming_High #Ambition #Goal_Setting
5.  **Cultivating a Distinctive Style**: One's style should not be forced but should emerge naturally as a by-product of doing the best job possible. Affectation or adopting a fake persona can show negatively in the work.
    -   **Tag**: #Distinctive_Style #Authenticity #Career_Development

## References
10.  The concept of undirected thinking highlights the role of letting the mind wander intermittently with focused work to stimulate creativity and problem-solving.
11.  High aims in work are critical, as they can be liberating, simplifying, and exciting. The aim should be to be the best, rather than just good.
12.  A distinctive style emerges naturally when one strives to do their best. Affectation or adopting a fake persona can negatively impact the work.

## Tasks and Goals
-   **Task 1**: Cultivate consistency and appreciate the cumulative effect of work.
-   **Task 2**: Understand and invest in the potential for exponential growth in your work.
-   **Task 3**: Allow for undirected thinking, avoiding distractions that might undermine its effectiveness.
-   **Task 4**: Aim to be the best in your field and let your distinctive style evolve naturally.

## Earnestness and Great Work
-   In order to avoid affectation, be earnest.
-   Earnestness includes intellectual honesty and informality.
-   Intellectual honesty sharpens one's vision for truth and new ideas. Aggressively admitting mistakes lightens the burden.
-   Informality means focusing on what matters and ignoring insignificant aspects. This is also an advantage that nerds have, helping them produce great work.
-   Maintain innocence and boldness, taking risks and putting ideas out there.
-   Optimism aids in great work; be ready to risk looking foolish.

[[Earnestness]]<br> [[Intellectual Honesty]]<br> [[Informality]]<br> [[Optimism]]

## Consistency and Redoing Work
-   Great work is often consistent with the person doing it and the work itself.
-   Sometimes, work needs to be redone for consistency. Be willing to throw away and redo things for better results.
-   Ask: If I'd already made the change, would I want to revert to what I have now?
-   Have the confidence to cut or remove elements that do not fit, even if they were difficult to achieve.
[[Consistency]]<br> [[Redoing Work]]<br> [[Confidence in Cutting]]

## Elegance and Essence
-   Stripping your work down to its essence can make it more powerful.
-   Elegance, though seen as a long-term bet, is a useful standard well beyond math.
-   Best work may seem effortless as it was already there and just needed to be discovered.
-   Consider your work as a process of discovery, and think of yourself as a conduit for the ideas to take shape.
-   Great work often serves as a tool for others to build upon.
[[Elegance]]<br> [[Essence]]<br> [[Discovery]]<br> [[Great Work as a Tool]]

## Originality and Creativity
-   Great ideas need to be true and new.
-   Originality, creativity, and imagination are separate skills.
-   Original thinkers can't help but generate new ideas; it's a habit of mind.
-   Original ideas come from trying to build or understand something slightly too difficult.
-   Writing or talking about things you're interested in is a good way to generate new ideas.
[[Originality]]<br> [[Creativity]]<br> [[Imagination]]

## Generating New Ideas
-   Changing your context, like visiting new places or walking, can help generate new ideas.
-   Travelling in topic space by exploring different topics can result in new ideas.
-   Distribute your attention according to a power law; be professionally curious about a few topics and idly curious about many more.
-   Curiosity feeds originality and is a kind of originality itself; it’s what originality is to answers.

# Discovering New Ideas
## Seizing New Ideas
-   **Discovering new ideas** is seeing things that were always there but in a different way. It can seem both novel and obvious at the same time.
-   **Contradiction in idea discovery**: Ideas are obvious after you've seen them, but hard to find as they require you to change your perception of the world.
-   We view the world through **models** that both assist and limit us. Fixing a broken model can lead to new ideas becoming apparent.
-   Finding these broken models is difficult, but one approach is to be stricter than others.
-   Signs of breakage in models come from the discrepancy between the model and reality. Many people ignore these signs due to their attachment to their existing models.

## Einstein's Example
-   Einstein didn't find new ideas by actively looking for them, but by being stricter in his interpretations of existing models.
-   **Rule-breaking is crucial** for model fixing. The new model often violates existing rules or assumptions.
-   Initially, new ideas might seem to go against convention, but they become reasonable once the new model they bring is adopted.
-   Good new ideas may appear bad or crazy at first. They are exciting and full of implications. Bad ideas, on the other hand, are depressing.

## Two Types of Rule-breakers
-   Rule-breakers can be **aggressively independent-minded**, deriving pleasure from rule-breaking.
-   Alternatively, rule-breakers can be **passively independent-minded**, not caring about rules or not even knowing they exist.
-   Novices, outsiders, and individuals on the autism spectrum may show passive independent-mindedness due to ignorance of the field's assumptions or immunity to conventional beliefs.

## Model Fixing: Strictness & Rule-breaking
-   Strictness and rule-breaking may seem contradictory but they're crucial to model fixing.
-   Popular culture presents strictness and rule-breaking as opposites. This is a misconception based on the consideration of trivial matters. For important matters, rule-breaking is necessary to achieve strictness.

## Uncovering Overlooked Ideas
-   Overlooked ideas get discarded subconsciously due to fear of being too weird, risky, hard, or controversial.
-   You can discover overlooked ideas by thinking about good ideas for others to explore or by examining the obscurities that block these ideas.
-   Any cherished but mistaken principle has valuable ideas hidden around it. This is especially true for religious principles that are taken too literally or metaphorically.
-   To uncover these hidden ideas, consider what people in your field are too attached to. What possibilities open up if you let go of these?

## Choosing Problems to Solve
-   People often display originality in solving problems, but not in deciding which problems to solve. They tend to be conservative in their choice of problems.
-   Problems are bigger bets than solutions and could occupy years, leading to a conservative approach. However, many are overly conservative due to not just risk but also fashion.
-   Unfashionable problems are undervalued. The most interesting kind is one that seems fully explored but actually isn't. Don't be deterred by others' skepticism.
-   Working on unfashionable problems can be rewarding. There's no rush, and there's satisfaction in cultivating otherwise wasted ideas.
-   Another type of overlooked problem doesn't appear important, but is. These can be found by being self-indulgent and letting your curiosity guide you.
-   If you were to work on something just because it's interesting, what would it be? The answer might be more important than it seems.
-   Originality in problem selection is more critical than in problem-solving. It differentiates those who discover entirely new fields.

## Changing Perspective to Find New Ideas
-   **Good ideas** often seem both **novel and obvious** at the same time. This seeming contradiction arises because seeing the new idea usually requires you to change the way you look at the world, which is hard.
-   **Models** we use to understand the world can help and constrain us. When you **fix a broken model**, new ideas become obvious. However, identifying and fixing a broken model is challenging.
-   **Discovering broken models** can be achieved by being stricter than other people. Broken models leave a trail of clues where they clash with reality, which most people ignore due to their attachment to their current model. To find new ideas, we must seize on signs of breakage instead of looking away.

## Embracing Rule-breaking and Independent-mindedness
-   **Breaking rules** is essential to fix your model of the world. The new model usually breaks at least implicit rules from the perspective of the old model.
-   Many don't understand the degree of rule-breaking required for new ideas, because new ideas seem conservative once they succeed. In reality, new ideas initially seem crazy and wrong to most people.
-   Ideas that seem crazy but exciting, rich in implications, and not depressing, can be the **right kind of crazy** for new ideas. Identifying such ideas with certainty is impossible.
-   **Independently-minded people** are comfortable breaking rules and come in two types: those who enjoy breaking them (**aggressively independent-minded**) and those indifferent to them (**passively independent-minded**).

## Discovering Overlooked Ideas
-   We often see overlooked ideas subconsciously but dismiss them because they seem too weird, risky, or controversial. To counter this, one strategy is to ask what would be good ideas for someone else to explore.
-   **Cherished but mistaken principles** hide valuable ideas in their shadow. Any principle too attached to by people in your field can be a source of new ideas if discarded.

## Choosing the Right Problems to Solve
-   People often show more **originality in solving problems** than in deciding which problems to solve. This leads to them working on fashionable problems, even though unfashionable problems are undervalued.
-   The most common type of overlooked problem doesn't seem to matter as much as it actually does. These can be found by being self-indulgent and allowing your curiosity to guide you.
-   **Originality in choosing problems** can be more important than originality in solving them, as it can lead to the discovery of whole new fields.

## Understanding the Power of Unanswered Questions
-   **Questions** can be just as important as answers in the process of developing new ideas. In schools, questions are quickly answered, but a really good question is a partial discovery in itself.
-   Unanswered questions can be uncomfortable, but they also increase the chance of noticing a solution or that two unanswered questions are the same.
-   The **more puzzled you are** about important, yet understood things, the better. Originality consists partly of puzzlement and confusion.
-   The best way to acquire new questions is to try answering existing ones. Questions lead not only to answers but also to more questions.

## Embracing Curiosity, Being Prolific, and Starting Small
-   The best questions grow in the answering. It's beneficial to be promiscuously curious and try many small things. Being prolific is underrated.
-   The journey from starting small to doing something great involves making **successive versions** of your idea or product. The final version is usually more clever and ambitious than anything initially planned.
-   **Planning** isn't always beneficial. It's sometimes necessary, but can be avoided by keeping projects small and using flexible media, allowing your designs to evolve instead.
-   Don't be afraid to take risks as per your capability. If you're not failing occasionally, you're probably being too conservative. Even a project that fails can be valuable as it will lead you to ask questions few others have asked.

## Youth, Inexperience, and Discovery

### Advantages of Youth

1.  Energy, time, optimism, and freedom are characteristic advantages of youth.
2.  The aged tend to recognize the advantages they hold better than the young.
3.  Time is a significant advantage that the young have but often fail to realize.
4.  One effective way to leverage time in youth is to use it in seemingly frivolous ways – learning out of curiosity, trying to build something cool, or striving to become exceptionally good at something.
5.  While time in youth should be spent liberally, it shouldn't be wasted outright. Engaging in activities that might be seen as a waste of time, but offer potential learning or growth, is encouraged.

### Inexperience and Discovery
1.  Inexperience can provide a fresh perspective on existing ideas. When you're embracing an idea for the first time, pay attention to elements that seem wrong or missing.
2.  Keep track of any initial misgivings about the idea. As you delve deeper into the subject, revisit these doubts. If they remain viable, they could lead to an undiscovered idea.

## Learning from Experience, Overcoming Passivity, and Defying Schooling

### Learning from Experience
1.  Experience imparts knowledge of what to worry about and what to disregard, a discernment that the inexperienced often lack.
2.  False notions and bad habits picked up over time need to be unlearned before you can excel in your work.

### Overcoming Passivity and Schooling
1.  Schools tend to induce passivity, providing a warped understanding of learning and thinking. Strive to overcome this passivity.
2.  Start thinking of education as your project, with teachers serving as your advisors rather than leaders.
3.  Schools give a misleading impression of what work is like, setting predefined problems that are usually solvable. In real life, you must identify the problems yourself, often without knowing whether they're solvable.
4.  Avoid the school-taught mentality of winning by hacking the test. Aim for original problem-solving and don't skimp on the work involved.

## On Copying, Collaborating, and Management

### The Art of Copying
1.  Copying existing work when new to a field can be a valuable learning method. However, it's crucial to copy openly and consciously.
2.  Even the most novel ideas can initially appear derivative because they often start as variations of existing concepts.
3.  While copying, avoid imitating every aspect of the original. Some features may be context-dependent, and reproducing them could be inappropriate or even detrimental.
4.  Copying between different fields can yield fruitful results. Deliberately learning about other kinds of work can facilitate this.

### The Value of Colleagues
1.  Quality colleagues are instrumental in doing great work. Seek out colleagues you admire and want to become like.
2.  Quality takes precedence over quantity when it comes to colleagues. History indicates that clusters of high-quality individuals often produce great work.
3.  Indicators of good colleagues include their ability to offer surprising insights and do things you can't.

### Management and Large-Scale Projects
1.  Some projects require large-scale collaboration and management skills.
2.  If you don't have an interest or aptitude in management, you should either learn it as a secondary skill or avoid large-scale projects.

# **Doing Great Work 

**MDE (Minimum Digital Effort)**
1.  **Husband Your Morale**:
    -   Morale is crucial for ambitious projects and directly tied to your outlook on life.
    -   High morale can be cyclical, enhancing work productivity and quality.
    -   Anticipate setbacks and consider them a part of the process instead of morale-breaking obstacles.
    -   Be cautious with your efforts and avoid needless backtracking. Never abandon your core desire.
    -   Learn to distinguish "good pain" from "bad pain"; the former is a sign of effort, the latter a sign of damage.
2.  **Support System**:
    -   An audience, no matter how small, contributes significantly to morale.
    -   Avoid intermediaries between you and your audience where possible.
    -   Surround yourself with individuals who increase your energy and understand your need to work.
    -   Your physical health impacts morale - exercise regularly, eat well, sleep enough, and avoid harmful substances.
3.  **Productivity and Happiness**:
    -   Doing great work doesn't guarantee happiness, but it can prevent bitterness in ambitious individuals.
4.  **Influence and Competition**:
    -   Be selective about whose opinions matter to you - fame adds noise, not value.
    -   Prestige should not dictate your work - strive for excellence in your chosen field.
    -   Competition can motivate, but don't let it define your goals.
    -   Your curiosity is the best guide in selecting and pursuing your work.
5.  **Role of Curiosity**:
    
    -   Curiosity is essential in the four steps of doing great work: choosing the field, reaching the frontier, noticing gaps, and exploring them.
6.  **Factors in Great Work**:
    
    -   Ability, interest, effort, and luck are the factors in doing great work.
    -   You cannot control luck, and effort is a given. The challenge is to find work where ability and interest combine explosively.
    -   Don't let fear and modesty hold you back from attempting to do great work.
7.  **Final Note**:
    
    -   It's okay to fail. It's a part of the journey to doing great work. Aim to work on something very interesting to make the hard work feel less burdensome.

**Questions for Reflection:**

1.  How do I currently handle setbacks? How can I better integrate setbacks into my process rather than allowing them to derail my morale?
2.  Who are the people that currently increase my energy? How can I surround myself with more of these individuals?
3.  How can I nurture my curiosity to guide me in my work?
4.  How can I actively combat the fear and modesty that might be holding me back from attempting great work?
5.  How do my physical health habits currently affect my work morale? What changes could I implement for a positive impact?

  
**Notes**  
  
[1] I don't think you could give a precise definition of what counts as great work. Doing great work means doing something important so well that you expand people's ideas of what's possible. But there's no threshold for importance. It's a matter of degree, and often hard to judge at the time anyway. So I'd rather people focused on developing their interests rather than worrying about whether they're important or not. Just try to do something amazing, and leave it to future generations to say if you succeeded.  
  
[2] A lot of standup comedy is based on noticing anomalies in everyday life. "Did you ever notice...?" New ideas come from doing this about nontrivial things. Which may help explain why people's reaction to a new idea is often the first half of laughing: Ha!  
  
[3] That second qualifier is critical. If you're excited about something most authorities discount, but you can't give a more precise explanation than "they don't get it," then you're starting to drift into the territory of cranks.  
  
[4] Finding something to work on is not simply a matter of finding a match between the current version of you and a list of known problems. You'll often have to coevolve with the problem. That's why it can sometimes be so hard to figure out what to work on. The search space is huge. It's the cartesian product of all possible types of work, both known and yet to be discovered, and all possible future versions of you.  
  
There's no way you could search this whole space, so you have to rely on heuristics to generate promising paths through it and hope the best matches will be clustered. Which they will not always be; different types of work have been collected together as much by accidents of history as by the intrinsic similarities between them.  
  
[5] There are many reasons curious people are more likely to do great work, but one of the more subtle is that, by casting a wide net, they're more likely to find the right thing to work on in the first place.  
  
[6] It can also be dangerous to make things for an audience you feel is less sophisticated than you, if that causes you to talk down to them. You can make a lot of money doing that, if you do it in a sufficiently cynical way, but it's not the route to great work. Not that anyone using this m.o. would care.  
  
[7] This idea I learned from Hardy's _A Mathematician's Apology_, which I recommend to anyone ambitious to do great work, in any field.  
  
[8] Just as we overestimate what we can do in a day and underestimate what we can do over several years, we overestimate the damage done by procrastinating for a day and underestimate the damage done by procrastinating for several years.  
  
[9] You can't usually get paid for doing exactly what you want, especially early on. There are two options: get paid for doing work close to what you want and hope to push it closer, or get paid for doing something else entirely and do your own projects on the side. Both can work, but both have drawbacks: in the first approach your work is compromised by default, and in the second you have to fight to get time to do it.  
  
[10] If you set your life up right, it will deliver the focus-relax cycle automatically. The perfect setup is an office you work in and that you walk to and from.  
  
[11] There may be some very unworldly people who do great work without consciously trying to. If you want to expand this rule to cover that case, it becomes: Don't try to be anything except the best.  
  
[12] This gets more complicated in work like acting, where the goal is to adopt a fake persona. But even here it's possible to be affected. Perhaps the rule in such fields should be to avoid _unintentional_ affectation.  
  
[13] It's safe to have beliefs that you treat as unquestionable if and only if they're also unfalsifiable. For example, it's safe to have the principle that everyone should be treated equally under the law, because a sentence with a "should" in it isn't really a statement about the world and is therefore hard to disprove. And if there's no evidence that could disprove one of your principles, there can't be any facts you'd need to ignore in order to preserve it.  
  
[14] Affectation is easier to cure than intellectual dishonesty. Affectation is often a shortcoming of the young that burns off in time, while intellectual dishonesty is more of a character flaw.  
  
[15] Obviously you don't have to be working at the exact moment you have the idea, but you'll probably have been working fairly recently.  
  
[16] Some say psychoactive drugs have a similar effect. I'm skeptical, but also almost totally ignorant of their effects.  
  
[17] For example you might give the nth most important topic (m-1)/m^n of your attention, for some m > 1. You couldn't allocate your attention so precisely, of course, but this at least gives an idea of a reasonable distribution.  
  
[18] The principles defining a religion have to be mistaken. Otherwise anyone might adopt them, and there would be nothing to distinguish the adherents of the religion from everyone else.  
  
[19] It might be a good exercise to try writing down a list of questions you wondered about in your youth. You might find you're now in a position to do something about some of them.  
  
[20] The connection between originality and uncertainty causes a strange phenomenon: because the conventional-minded are more certain than the independent-minded, this tends to give them the upper hand in disputes, even though they're generally stupider.

> The best lack all conviction, while the worst

[22] Attacking a project as a "toy" is similar to attacking a statement as "inappropriate." It means that no more substantial criticism can be made to stick.  
  
[23] One way to tell whether you're wasting time is to ask if you're producing or consuming. Writing computer games is less likely to be a waste of time than playing them, and playing games where you create something is less likely to be a waste of time than playing games where you don't.  
  
[24] Another related advantage is that if you haven't said anything publicly yet, you won't be biased toward evidence that supports your earlier conclusions. With sufficient integrity you could achieve eternal youth in this respect, but few manage to. For most people, having previously published opinions has an effect similar to ideology, just in quantity 1.  
  
[25] In the early 1630s Daniel Mytens made a painting of Henrietta Maria handing a laurel wreath to Charles I. Van Dyck then painted his own version to show how much better he was.  
  
[26] I'm being deliberately vague about what a place is. As of this writing, being in the same physical place has advantages that are hard to duplicate, but that could change.  
  
[27] This is false when the work the other people have to do is very constrained, as with SETI@home or Bitcoin. It may be possible to expand the area in which it's false by defining similarly restricted protocols with more freedom of action in the nodes.  
  
[28] Corollary: Building something that enables people to go around intermediaries and engage directly with their audience is probably a good idea.  
  
[29] It may be helpful always to walk or run the same route, because that frees attention for thinking. It feels that way to me, and there is some historical evidence for it.
