### Data Model Enhancements

1. **Event Item**: The smallest unit containing key-value pairs, stored with base64 encoding for lightweight data transfer.
   ```json
   { "device_type": "ios" }
   ```
2. **Event**: Contains multiple event items, uniquely identified by a combination of `event_time` and `event_id`, ensuring idempotency.
   ```json
   {
     "event_time": "2024-10-03T21:24:23.988Z",
     "event_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
     "event_items": [{ "event_item_key": "device_type", "event_item_value": "ios" }]
   }
   ```
3. **Time Series ID**: Represents an ordered collection of events, stored over a defined retention period, with all events being immutable.
4. **Namespace**: An organizational unit for time series data that allows configurable storage policies at the dataset level.
### Partitioning Strategy
- **Time Slices**: Data is organized into **discrete time slices** that map directly to Cassandra tables, preventing wide-partition issues.
- **Time Buckets**: Within each time slice, data is further segmented into **time buckets** to facilitate efficient range scans.
- **Event Buckets**: High-throughput writes are distributed across event buckets to reduce partition hot-spots and improve write performance.

#### ASCII Representation of Data Partitioning
```
Event Time --> Time Slice --> Time Bucket --> Event Bucket
```
### Why Avoid Row-Based TTL?
- **Drawbacks of TTL**: Generating **tombstones** from TTL deletions can degrade Cassandra's performance due to resource-heavy range scans.
- **Time Slice Strategy**: Uses entire time slices that can be dropped without generating tombstones, making data retention adjustments more flexible and cost-efficient.
### Dynamic Bucketing and Compaction
- **Future Enhancements**: Includes plans for **dynamic event bucketing** to better handle varying data loads, aiming to reduce read amplification by tailoring partition sizes dynamically.
- **Compaction**: Utilizes the immutability of older data to perform **dynamic compaction**, optimizing read paths and reducing storage costs.
