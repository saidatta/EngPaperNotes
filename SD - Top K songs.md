Here is the revised design for the "Top K Songs in the Last 24 Hours with Real-Time Updates" feature:

The feature works as follows:

1. **Load Balancer**: User requests are routed through a load balancer, which distributes the requests across multiple servers to ensure high availability and reliability.

2. **User Listens to a Song**: When a user listens to a song, the system records this event.

3. **Send Event to Kafka**: The song play event is sent to a Kafka topic. Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform that can handle high volumes of real-time data.

4. **Sliding Window**: The events in the Kafka topic are stored in a sliding window of the last 24 hours. This means that only events that occurred in the last 24 hours are considered for the top K songs calculation.

5. **Ranking Algorithm**: The ranking algorithm runs continuously on the events in the sliding window. This algorithm calculates the top K songs based on the play counts in the last 24 hours.

6. **Top K Songs List**: The ranking algorithm generates a list of the top K songs. This list is stored in a distributed database (Cassandra) for quick access.

7. **Display to Users**: The top K songs list is displayed to users. Users can see the most popular songs based on the listening habits of all users in the last 24 hours.

8. **Cassandra**: The top K songs list is stored in Cassandra, a distributed database that provides high availability and scalability. The data is partitioned by song ID to ensure efficient data retrieval.

This design assumes a distributed system to handle the large volume of real-time play events and to provide high availability and quick access to the top K songs. The ranking algorithm runs continuously to provide real-time updates to the top K songs list. The use of a sliding window and a distributed database like Cassandra allows the system to handle the requirements of this feature effectively.
