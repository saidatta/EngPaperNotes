## Overview:

HikariCP is a widely used connection pool in the Java world. This note breaks down its initialization process, core components, and monitoring tools for efficient usage in a SpringBoot2 application.

## Initialization Process

### Roles involved in Connection Management:
- **HikariDataSource**: The default data source implementation class loaded by SpringBoot2.
- **HikariPool**: The actual connection pool management class. It manages operations like acquiring, discarding, closing, and recycling connections.
  - It internally holds `ConcurrentBag` objects.
- **ConcurrentBag**: Contains the real connection.
  - Internally, it holds `CopyWriteArrayList` object named `sharedList`.
  - It also provides a thread-level connection cache through `threadList`.
- **ProxyFactory**: Generates a wrapper class called `HikariProxyConnection`.
  - It wraps around additional operations and uses the Javassist technology.
  - Refer to `JavassistProxyFactory` for specific logic.

### Service Start Logic:

When the service starts, the connection pool is loaded. Here's a sample code snippet for loading the connection pool in a SpringBoot2 application:

```java
@Bean(name = "agreementDataSource")
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "mybatis")
public DataSource agreementDataSource() {
    return DataSourceBuilder.create().build();
}

@Bean(name = "readSource")
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "mybatis.read")
public DataSource readSource() {
    return DataSourceBuilder.create().build();
}
```

In the above code:
- The `DataSource` bean is simply initialized.
- The internal `HikariPool` isn't initialized at this point.
- `HikariPool` initialization logic is delayed until the connection is fetched for the first time.

### Connection Fetch Logic:

The first time a connection is fetched, the following logic is executed:

```java
@Override
public Connection getConnection() throws SQLException {
    if (isClosed()) {
        throw new SQLException("HikariDataSource " + this + " has been closed.");
    }

    if (fastPathPool != null) {
        return fastPathPool.getConnection();
    }

    HikariPool result = pool;
    if (result == null) {
        synchronized (this) {
            result = pool;
            if (result == null) {
                validate();
                LOGGER.info("{} - Starting...", getPoolName());
                try {
                    pool = result = new HikariPool(this);
                    this.seal();
                } catch (PoolInitializationException pie) {
                    if (pie.getCause() instanceof SQLException) {
                        throw (SQLException) pie.getCause();
                    } else {
                        throw pie;
                    }
                }
                LOGGER.info("{} - Start completed.", getPoolName());
            }
        }
    }

    return result.getConnection();
}
```

Here, the logic first checks if the connection pool is initialized. If not, it initializes the connection pool. Note the usage of `volatile` with the `pool` object which ensures its visibility across threads.

### Pool Initialization:

The connection pool (`HikariPool`) is initialized using the following logic:

```java
public HikariPool(final HikariConfig config) {
    super(config);
    // ... [rest of the initialization logic]
}
```

This method initializes various connection pool properties, generates a data source (`DriverDataSource`) for producing physical connections, and sets up necessary thread pools and tasks.

## Monitoring:

For effective usage and maintenance, it's crucial to have real-time insights into the connection pool's status and performance.

### Monitoring Implementations:

HikariCP has built-in monitoring mechanisms. If customization is required, you can expand the necessary interface:

```java
public interface MetricsTrackerFactory {
   IMetricsTracker create(String poolName, PoolStats poolStats);
}
```

### Default Metrics:

Here are some default metrics provided by HikariCP:
- `hikaricp_connections_pending`: Number of threads waiting for connections.
- `hikaricp_connections_acquire`: Time taken to obtain the connection.
- `hikaricp_connections_timeout`: Number of threads where the connection timed out.
- `hikaricp_connections_active`: Number of active connections.

## Key Takeaways:

1. HikariCP has a lazy initialization process, and the connection pool (`HikariPool`) isn't initialized until a connection is fetched for the first time.
2. Monitoring tools provided by HikariCP are essential for real-time insights and ensuring efficient performance.
3. HikariCP's metrics like `hikaricp_connections_pending`, `hikaricp_connections_acquire`, etc., are crucial indicators for troubleshooting and maintaining the connection pool's health.
## Configuration Interpretation

**1. connectionTimeout**

- **Description**: Maximum time to wait for a connection from the pool.
- **Default**: 30000ms
- **Recommended Configuration**: Default value is generally sufficient. However, for frequent interactions, consider reducing this value.

**2. idleTimeout**

- **Description**: Maximum time a connection can be idle in the pool.
- **Default**: 600000ms
- **Recommended Configuration**: Default can be used unless specific requirements dictate otherwise.

**3. maxLifetime**

- **Description**: Maximum lifespan of a connection in the pool.
- **Default**: 1800000ms
- **Recommended Configuration**: Set it slightly less than the database's timeout value.

**4. minimumIdle**

- **Description**: Minimum number of idle connections in the pool.
- **Default**: 10
- **Recommended Configuration**: Configure based on peak traffic requirements.

**5. maximumPoolSize**

- **Description**: Maximum number of connections in the pool.
- **Default**: 10
- **Recommended Configuration**: Configure it to be several times higher than `minimumIdle`.

## Summary

- **Initialization**: HikariCP's initialization is mostly triggered when the first connection is requested.
- **Monitoring**: HikariCP provides vital monitoring indicators which are essential to understand the online performance of the connection pool.
- **Configurations**: HikariCP's default configurations can be tuned based on individual application requirements to ensure the connection pool doesn't become a service bottleneck.
