This class, `TransportVersion`, represents the version of the wire protocol used for communication between Elasticsearch nodes. It separates the wire protocol version from the release version of Elasticsearch. 

Here are the key points about this class:

1. **Versioning**: Each transport version has a unique ID number and a unique ID string. The ID number was the same as the release version for versions prior to 8.9.0 for backward compatibility. Starting from 8.9.0, the ID number is an incrementing number, disconnected from the release version. The unique ID string is not used in the binary protocol but ensures each protocol version is added to the source file only once.

2. **Version Compatibility**: The earliest compatible version is hardcoded in the `MINIMUM_COMPATIBLE` field. The earliest Cross Cluster Search (CCS) compatible version is hardcoded at `MINIMUM_CCS_VERSION`.

3. **Adding a New Version**: A new transport version should be added every time a change is made to the serialization protocol of one or more classes. To add a new transport version, a new constant is added at the bottom of the list that is one greater than the current highest version, and the `CURRENT` constant is updated to point to the new version.

4. **Reverting a Transport Version**: If a commit with a transport version change is reverted, a new transport version representing the reverted change must be created. The transport version must always be incremented and should not go backwards.

5. **Registration of Versions**: Each version is registered using the `registerTransportVersion` method, which checks for uniqueness of the ID. The `IDS` map is used during class construction and is cleared after all the transport versions have been registered.

6. **Comparison and Compatibility Checks**: The class provides methods to compare versions and check if a specified version is compatible with the current version of Elasticsearch.

7. **Serialization**: The class provides methods to read and write the version from and to a `StreamInput` and `StreamOutput` respectively.

In summary, this class is crucial for managing the communication protocol versions between Elasticsearch nodes and ensuring backward compatibility.

### FAQ
1. How is Transport version different from release version? why do we need to seperate them?
The `TransportVersion` and the release version in Elasticsearch serve different purposes.

The release version represents the version of the Elasticsearch software that is running. It includes major, minor, and patch versions and is incremented with each new release of Elasticsearch. This version is used for understanding the features, improvements, and bug fixes that are included in a particular release of Elasticsearch.

On the other hand, the `TransportVersion` represents the version of the wire protocol used for communication between Elasticsearch nodes. The wire protocol is the format and rules that Elasticsearch nodes use to talk to each other. 

The need to separate `TransportVersion` from the release version arises from the requirement to maintain backward compatibility in a distributed system like Elasticsearch. When you upgrade Elasticsearch, you typically do not upgrade all nodes at the same time. During the upgrade process, you will have nodes running different versions of Elasticsearch in the same cluster. These nodes need to be able to communicate with each other effectively. 

By separating the `TransportVersion` from the release version, it allows changes to the wire protocol to be made independently of changes to the Elasticsearch software. This means that nodes running different versions of Elasticsearch can still communicate with each other, as long as they support the same `TransportVersion`. 

In addition, having a separate `TransportVersion` allows for more granular control over changes to the wire protocol. For example, if a change is made to the serialization protocol of a class, a new `TransportVersion` can be added, even if there is no new release of Elasticsearch. This helps ensure that all nodes in a cluster can correctly serialize and deserialize data, even if they are running different versions of Elasticsearch.
