# Rust's Single-Threaded Shareable Mutable Containers
aliases: [Shareable Mutable Containers, Cell, RefCell, OnceCell, Interior Mutability in Rust]
tags: [rust, engineering, advanced, interior-mutability, memory-management]
This note covers Rust's **interior mutability** constructs for single-threaded scenarios:
- **Cell**
- **RefCell**
- **OnceCell**

These allow mutable access to data even when you hold only an immutable reference to the container, with different trade-offs on runtime checks, copying, etc.

> **Note**: For **multi-threaded** scenarios, you should use [`Mutex<T>`], [`RwLock<T>`], [`OnceLock<T>`], or **atomic** types (from `std::sync::atomic::*`).

---

## 1. **Background: Rust's Borrowing Rules**

Normally, Rust enforces the rule:

- You can have **many immutable references** (`&T`) **OR**
- **One** mutable reference (`&mut T`) to some data, but not both simultaneously.

This ensures **no data races** and **no undefined behavior** from illegal aliasing. However, there are cases where you need to **mutate data even while aliases exist**—that's where **interior mutability** comes in.

---

## 2. **Overview of Interior Mutability**

**Interior mutability** means allowing mutation by **hiding** it from the borrow checker with a specialized type. These types wrap your data and let you **mutate** it from a shared reference (`&T`). That breaks the usual compile-time rule but is done **safely** through runtime checks (or restricted usage patterns).

For **single-thread** only:
- [`Cell<T>`]: Copy/replace-based approach.
- [`RefCell<T>`]: Runtime borrowing checks (panics on violation).
- [`OnceCell<T>`]: Single-assignment cell (set once, read many).
---
## 3. **Cell<T\>**

### 3.1 Concept

- **`Cell<T>`** provides interior mutability by **copying** or **moving** values in/out of the cell, rather than giving direct references to the inner data.
- You cannot borrow the inner data as a `&mut T`. Instead you *set* or *replace* the contents.
- `Cell` is most suitable for types that are small or `Copy`, so the overhead of copying is minimal.
### 3.2 Key Operations
1. **`Cell::new(x)`**: Create a new cell holding `x`.
2. **`get()`** *(for `T: Copy`)*: returns a copy of the value inside.
3. **`set(x)`**: replaces the current interior value with `x`, dropping the old one.
4. **`replace(x)`**: replaces the value, returning the old value.
5. **`take()`** *(if `T: Default`)*: returns the old value and replaces with `T::default()`.
6. **`into_inner()`**: consumes the `Cell`, returning the inner value.
### 3.3 Example
```rust
use std::cell::Cell;

struct MyStruct {
    regular: u8,
    special: Cell<u8>,
}

let s = MyStruct {
    regular: 0,
    special: Cell::new(42),
};

// s.regular = 100; // error: s is immutable
s.special.set(100);  // OK: interior mutability
assert_eq!(s.special.get(), 100);
```

> **Why**? Because `special` is a `Cell<u8>`, we can mutate it even though `s` is not mutable.

---

## 4. **RefCell<T>**

### 4.1 Concept

- **`RefCell<T>`** tracks borrows at runtime, instead of compile-time.
- **Multiple `&T`** references are allowed if no `&mut T` is active, or **one `&mut T`** is allowed if no `&T` references exist.
- If these runtime rules are violated, `RefCell` **panics**.

### 4.2 Borrowing Methods

1. **`borrow()`** → returns a `Ref<T>` (an immutable borrow).
   - If already mutably borrowed, **panics**.
2. **`borrow_mut()`** → returns a `RefMut<T>` (a mutable borrow).
   - If already borrowed (either immutably or mutably), **panics**.
3. **`try_borrow()`** / **`try_borrow_mut()`** → non-panicking versions returning `Result<Ref<T>, BorrowError>` or `Result<RefMut<T>, BorrowMutError>`.

### 4.3 Example

```rust
use std::rc::Rc;
use std::cell::RefCell;
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn main() {
    let shared_map: Rc<RefCell<HashMap<&'static str, i32>>> =
        Rc::new(RefCell::new(HashMap::new()));
    
    // Mutably borrow for insertion
    {
        let mut map_ref = shared_map.borrow_mut();
        map_ref.insert("apple", 32);
        map_ref.insert("banana", 15);
    } // mutable borrow ends

    // Now immutably borrow for reading
    let sum: i32 = shared_map.borrow().values().sum();
    println!("Sum of values = {sum}");
}
```

- Attempting to `borrow()` while a `borrow_mut()` is active leads to **thread panic** at runtime.

### 4.4 Use Cases

- **When data is large** and you don't want to copy it each time (like you'd have to with `Cell<T>`).
- When you have a **shared** data structure (e.g., behind an `Rc<T>`) and need to mutate it in place.

---

## 5. **OnceCell<T>**

### 5.1 Concept

- **`OnceCell<T>`** is for **values that get assigned exactly once**, then remain read-only.
- After initialization, you can get a reference to the data (like an immutable reference), **without** copying it or running runtime checks repeatedly.

### 5.2 Key Methods

1. **`OnceCell::new()`**: creates an empty cell.
2. **`set(x)`**: sets the inner value if not already set, returns `Err(x)` if already set.
3. **`get()`**: returns `Option<&T>` with the stored value (if any).
4. **`get_or_init(|| ...)`**: initializes the cell with a closure if it’s empty; always returns `&T`.
5. **`get_mut()`**: gets a mutable reference to the inner value, but only if you hold a mutable reference to the `OnceCell`.

### 5.3 Example

```rust
use std::cell::OnceCell;

struct Graph {
    edges: Vec<(i32, i32)>,
    span_tree: OnceCell<Vec<(i32, i32)>>,
}

impl Graph {
    fn minimum_spanning_tree(&self) -> &[ (i32,i32) ] {
        self.span_tree.get_or_init(|| {
            // potentially expensive computation
            self.calc_span_tree()
        })
    }
    
    fn calc_span_tree(&self) -> Vec<(i32, i32)> {
        // ...
        vec![]
    }
}

fn main() {
    let g = Graph { edges: vec![], span_tree: OnceCell::new() };
    // The first call sets it
    let mst = g.minimum_spanning_tree();
    // The second call uses the cached data
    let mst_again = g.minimum_spanning_tree();
    assert!(std::ptr::eq(mst, mst_again));
}
```

> **Note**: The `OnceCell` is **similar** to `RefCell` in that it allows interior mutability, but **only once**. After being set, it doesn’t re-check or allow further modifications (unless you have a mutable reference to the `OnceCell` itself).

---

## 6. **When to Use Interior Mutability**

### 6.1 Introducing Mutability Inside Something Immutable

If you have a type like `Rc<T>` or `Arc<T>` which is shared (aliased), you can't normally mutate it. By storing a `RefCell` or `Cell` **inside** that `T`, you can reintroduce mutability in a controlled manner.

**Example**: `Rc<RefCell<HashMap<K,V>>>`

### 6.2 Implementation Details of Logically-Immutable Methods

Sometimes, from an API perspective, a method is “immutable” (e.g., caching results, lazy init). The actual implementation might mutate some hidden state:
- **Cache** results in a `RefCell` or `OnceCell`.
- Keep method signature as `&self`.

### 6.3 Mutating in `Clone`

`Clone::clone(&self)` is not supposed to modify `self` from an external perspective. But implementing reference counts in `Rc<T>` or `Arc<T>` does indeed mutate some internal counters. This is done with `Cell`/`UnsafeCell` so that the compiler doesn’t see it as a normal mutation.

---

## 7. **`UnsafeCell<T>`**

### 7.1 The Primitive

- **`UnsafeCell<T>`** is the **primitive** behind all interior mutability.
- It **opts out** of the immutability guarantee: a `&UnsafeCell<T>` can be used to obtain a `*mut T`.
- Usually, you won’t use `UnsafeCell` directly, but you might see it inside library types.

### 7.2 Relationship to `Cell`, `RefCell`, etc.

- `Cell<T>` and `RefCell<T>` are “safe abstractions” over `UnsafeCell<T>`.
- They impose additional rules (copy-based, runtime checks, single-init) to ensure safe usage.

---

## 8. **Comparisons**

|                | **Cell<T>**                     | **RefCell<T>**                                              | **OnceCell<T>**                      |
|----------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Mutation**   | By copying or moving out/in      | By borrowing at runtime (`Ref/RefMut`)                     | One-time set, then read-only         |
| **Runtime Check** | None (just overwrites)        | Yes (panics on conflicting borrows)                        | Only checks if set once (no reborrow checks) |
| **Best For**   | Small `Copy` types, cheap to clone | Larger types, multiple times mutably borrowed over time      | Data that only needs to be set once  |
| **Concurrent?**| No, must stay single-thread only | No, must stay single-thread only                            | No, must stay single-thread only     |

## 9. **Examples and Patterns**

### 9.1 Multi-Owner + Interior Mutability

Often used in conjunction with reference-counted pointers (`Rc<T>`):
```rust
use std::rc::Rc;
use std::cell::RefCell;

let shared_vec = Rc::new(RefCell::new(vec![1,2,3]));
{
  let mut mv = shared_vec.borrow_mut();  
  mv.push(4);
} // drop borrow

assert_eq!(shared_vec.borrow().len(), 4);
```
Inside the `RefCell`, you can mutate the vector while multiple owners exist.

### 9.2 Caching with `OnceCell`

```rust
use std::cell::OnceCell;

let cell = OnceCell::new();

cell.set("Hello").expect("Should not be set twice");
assert_eq!(cell.get(), Some(&"Hello"));

// If we try to set again, error:
assert!(cell.set("World").is_err());
```

---

## 10. **Common Pitfalls**

1. **Panics**: `RefCell::borrow()` panics if there is an existing `borrow_mut()`. 
2. **Data Races**: `RefCell`/`Cell` **are not** `Sync`. They are single-thread only. 
3. **`UnsafeCell`** is **very** low-level. Use higher-level abstractions unless you’re building your own cell type.
4. **Potential Overuse**: Interior mutability is powerful but can hide concurrency / aliasing issues if used incorrectly. Prefer normal borrowing or unique references when possible.

---

## 11. **Conclusion**

Rust's **shareable mutable containers** (`Cell`, `RefCell`, and `OnceCell`) allow you to opt out of normal static borrowing rules **in single-threaded contexts**, adding runtime or usage checks instead. These types form the basis of common **interior mutability** patterns in Rust, enabling:

- **Cell<T>**: simple, copy-based approach for small `Copy` data.
- **RefCell<T>**: dynamic checks for borrowing, more flexible for large data or repeated borrows.
- **OnceCell<T>**: single initialization, subsequent reads are by reference (no overhead).

**Key takeaway**: Use them wisely and only when you absolutely need interior mutability. They are extremely handy for **shared** or **conditionally mutated** data structures, caching, or APIs needing to appear immutable from the outside.
