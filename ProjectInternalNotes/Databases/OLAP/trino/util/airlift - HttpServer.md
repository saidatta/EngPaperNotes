Below is a logical explanation of the `HttpServer` class and what it does, presented as if you were an experienced engineer (like a PhD-level systems engineer) looking to understand how this server is assembled and runs. Alongside the explanation, you’ll find ASCII diagrams and examples for clarity.

### High-Level Purpose

The `HttpServer` class configures and starts a Jetty-based HTTP/HTTPS server with a variety of features:

- **Configurable Thread Pool and Execution Model:**  
  Uses a monitored, queued thread pool for handling requests. It can optionally leverage virtual threads for scalable concurrency.

- **HTTP and HTTPS Connectors:**  
  Sets up network endpoints (connectors) for both HTTP and HTTPS, with options for HTTP/2 and ALPN (Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation).

- **SSL and Certificate Management:**  
  Supports optional TLS (via an SSL context factory) and can reload certificates. It can also report days until certificate expiration.

- **Routing and Handlers:**  
  All requests flowing through the server pass through a pipeline of handlers, filters, and finally reach the main servlet or static resources.

- **Metrics and Logging:**  
  Exposes various JMX metrics (e.g., connection stats, thread pool stats) and can log incoming requests for auditing and troubleshooting.

---

### Logical Flow

1. **Thread Pool Initialization:**  
   The server starts by creating a `MonitoredQueuedThreadPool`. This is the pool of worker threads that handle incoming requests. Depending on configuration:
   - It sets minimum and maximum threads.
   - Enables detailed monitoring.
   - Optionally uses a virtual threads executor for request handling.

   **ASCII:**  
   ```
   +------------------------+
   |  MonitoredQueuedThreadPool
   |  (Worker Threads)
   +-----------+------------+
               |
             (Server uses these threads)
   ```

2. **Jetty `Server` Creation:**  
   A `Server` object from Jetty is then instantiated, which will manage connectors (HTTP/HTTPS) and dispatch requests to handlers.

   **ASCII:**  
   ```
   +--------- Jetty Server ----------+
   |           (Uses ThreadPool)     |
   +----------+----------------------+
              |
              v
        Server Connectors
   ```

3. **HTTP/HTTPS Connectors Setup:**  
   Based on the configuration (from `HttpServerConfig` and `HttpsConfig` if provided):
   - **HTTP Connector:** Opens a port for unencrypted traffic if `isHttpEnabled()` is true.  
   - **HTTPS Connector:** Opens a secure port with TLS. Uses `SslContextFactory` to manage certificates and encryption. Also sets up support for HTTP/2 if configured.

   **ASCII Conceptual Flow:**  
   ```
   HTTP Requests (Optional)      HTTPS Requests (Optional)
        |                              |
        v                              v
    +--------+                  +--------------+
    | HTTP   |                  |  HTTPS       |
    |Connector                  |  Connector   |
    +----+---+                  +------+-+-----+
         |                              |
   ```

   Each connector uses Jetty’s `HttpConfiguration` and customizers (like `ForwardedRequestCustomizer`, `SecureRequestCustomizer`) to handle headers, SSL, and protocol features. The connectors might look like a pipeline:

   **Pipeline View:**  
   ```
   +-----------+    +-----------+    +-----------+    +-----------+
   |  HTTP/2C  | -> |   HTTP/1  | -> | SSL/TLS   | -> | ALPN/HTTP2|
   +-----------+    +-----------+    +-----------+    +-----------+
   ```

   For HTTP: Just `HTTP/1` and `HTTP/2C` (cleartext HTTP/2) factories.  
   For HTTPS: TLS and ALPN are added to negotiate between HTTP/1 and HTTP/2.

4. **Handlers and Filters Chain:**
   Once the server accepts a connection, requests flow through a chain of handlers:
   
   1. **StatisticsHandler**:  
      Collects metrics about requests and responses.

   2. **GzipHandler** (optional):  
      If enabled, compresses responses to save bandwidth.

   3. **Filters**:  
      Filters can modify requests or responses before they hit the main servlet. For example, authentication filters or logging filters.

   4. **Servlet**:  
      Finally, the request reaches your main application logic, provided as a `Servlet`. This is typically where frameworks like Guice, Jersey, or custom servlets are integrated.

   **ASCII of Request Flow:**  
   ```
   Incoming Request
          |
          v
   +-----------------+
   | StatisticsHandler|   (Collects stats)
   +-------+---------+
           |
       +---+---+
       | Gzip? |    (Optionally compress response)
       +---+---+
           |
        +--+---+
        |Filters|    (e.g. Authentication, Logging)
        +--+---+
           |
       +---+---+
       | Servlet|    (Your main application)
       +-------+
   ```

5. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - **ErrorHandler**: Manages how errors are displayed in responses. Can show stack traces if configured.
   - **Request Logging**:  
     If enabled, requests can be logged to a file for auditing. The server configures a `JettyRequestLog` that writes access logs in a standard format, including optional compression.

6. **JMX Integration:**
   If an `MBeanServer` is provided, the server registers MBeans for:
   - Thread pool statistics
   - Connection statistics
   - SSL certificate information (like days until expiration)

   This makes it easy to monitor and manage the server in a production environment using standard JMX tools.

   **ASCII (Monitoring Flow):**  
   ```
   +-------------------+
   |   JMX MBeans      |
   | (ThreadPool, Conn,|
   |  SSL info, etc.)  |
   +---------+---------+
             |
        Admin/Monitoring Tools
   ```

7. **Starting and Stopping the Server:**
   - `@PostConstruct start()`: When this method is invoked, the server’s connectors are bound to ports, and it begins accepting requests.
   - `@PreDestroy stop()`: Before shutdown, `stop()` is called to gracefully close all connectors, stop handling new requests, and eventually free resources.

   This lifecycle management ensures that resources are properly initialized and cleaned up, important in long-running services.

### Example Scenario

**Example:** Suppose you have a web service that returns details about users. You enable HTTPS for security, set `maxThreads` to 100, and enable GZIP compression. The server configuration might do the following:

1. Start a thread pool with 100 threads.
2. Create an HTTPS connector on port 8443 with TLS and HTTP/2 enabled.
3. Add gzip compression so that responses are compressed if the client supports it.
4. Add a custom authentication filter to ensure all requests have valid credentials.
5. Serve requests via your main `UserServlet`, which returns JSON responses.

The flow of a single request might look like this:

```
Client -> HTTPS (TLS handshake) -> Jetty Server -> StatisticsHandler -> GzipHandler -> AuthFilter -> UserServlet -> Response
```

If the client requests user details, the server authenticates them (AuthFilter), retrieves user data (UserServlet), then gzips the response (GzipHandler) if needed, and finally returns it encrypted over HTTPS.

### Key Takeaways

- The `HttpServer` sets up a robust, production-ready Jetty server.
- It integrates HTTP/HTTPS, HTTP/2, request logging, compression, filters, and servlets.
- It uses a structured handler chain for request processing.
- It is configurable via `HttpServerConfig` and optional `HttpsConfig` for flexible deployments.
- It includes rich observability (JMX metrics), security (TLS), and performance controls (thread pool, compression).

In essence, this class encapsulates the complexity of starting a fully-featured, high-performance, and secure HTTP server, allowing you to focus on the business logic inside your servlets and filters.
