```

### 3.1 Clients
- **DataHub / Querybook** (Pinterest’s internal SQL authoring & visualization tool).
- **Jupyter** notebooks for interactive exploration.
- **Tableau** for business intelligence dashboards.
- **Internal microservices** that query Trino for data insights.
### 3.2 Gateway
- A fork of the **Lyft Presto Gateway**.
- Provides:
  - Query routing to the correct **Trino cluster** (ad-hoc vs. scheduled).
  - Load balancing based on cluster health and resource usage.
  - UI for historical query information (up to 2 weeks).
  - Visibility into resource usage by **organization** or **team**.
  - Quick diagnostics on failures or slow queries.
### 3.3 Production Clusters
- **Ad-hoc clusters**: 
  - Usually run on **Kubernetes** pods.
  - Serve user-generated queries with high concurrency and variable load.
- **Scheduled clusters**:
  - Usually on **dedicated EC2** instances to run predictable scheduled jobs.
- Additional **restricted clusters**:
  - For sensitive or personally identifiable information (**PII**).
  - Historically separated by distinct AWS IAM roles and separate machines.

## 4. Presto (Trino) Controller

Pinterest built an internal service called **“Presto Controller”** to manage cluster health and automate certain tasks. Key functionalities:

1. **Health Checks**: Periodic checks on each worker for responsiveness.
2. **Detect Slow Workers**: Drains them if the node is stuck or underperforming.
3. **Killing Expensive Queries**: Cancels queries blocking cluster resources.
4. **Rolling Restarts**: Orchestrates daily or periodic restarts to keep nodes healthy.
5. **Load-Based Scaling** (in the future): Potentially triggers changes to cluster size, though not fully automated yet due to cost and resource constraints.

---

## 5. Fine-Grained Access Control (FGAC)

### 5.1 Previous Model
- Separated entire environments or clusters by **IAM Roles**. 
  - “PII cluster” vs. “non-PII cluster.” 
- Access control largely tied to where the query runs.

### 5.2 New Model
- Centralized: **FGAC** based on **user’s LDAP groups**.
- **Flow**:
  1. User authenticates via OAuth or an **mtls** certificate => Yields a username.
  2. Trino coordinator verifies the user, requests a short-lived **Hive Metastore token**.
  3. A separate **token service** issues an **STS token** (AWS Security Token Service) that grants S3 read/write only for the data the user’s groups are authorized to see.
- **Benefits**:
  - Eliminates the need to maintain multiple separate physical clusters just for data access boundaries.
  - A single cluster (or fewer clusters) can handle all access, deciding by user identity and data policies.

**By the end of 2022**, Pinterest aimed to unify all PII and non-PII into a single environment using FGAC, removing the older environment-based approach.

## 6. Query Warnings & User Guidance

Pinterest invests heavily in **dynamic query warnings** to guide users toward efficient SQL. Examples:

1. **Large Table Scans**: If a query scans an extremely wide column or huge dataset, a warning prompts the user to reconsider or refine filters.
2. **Join Order or Type**: Detecting suboptimal join ordering or missing join conditions, prompting alternative strategies.
3. **Expensive Operations**: Warnings for queries with repeated cross joins, huge unfiltered aggregations, or complex expressions that can be optimized.

These warnings appear in the **query UI** or logs:
- Allows immediate user feedback to cancel or fix the query.
- Reduces cluster resource waste.

### 6.1 Example: Custom Warning Rule (Hypothetical)
```java
// Hypothetical snippet for custom warning
// You might integrate this into your Trino fork or plugin:

public class LargeTableScanWarningRule implements WarningRule {
    private static final long SCAN_THRESHOLD_BYTES = 500L * 1024 * 1024 * 1024; // 500GB

    @Override
    public Optional<Warning> apply(Plan plan, Metadata metadata, Session session) {
        long tableSize = getEstimatedScanSize(plan);
        if (tableSize > SCAN_THRESHOLD_BYTES) {
            return Optional.of(new Warning(
                WarningCode.LARGE_SCAN,
                format("Scanning over %d bytes. Consider partition pruning or limiting columns.", tableSize)
            ));
        }
        return Optional.empty();
    }
}
```

## 7. Resource Management & Diverse Workloads

### 7.1 Challenge
- **Ad-hoc queries**: spikes during business hours, can saturate the cluster unpredictably.
- **Scheduled queries**: can run off-peak, but sometimes they coincide with big ad-hoc loads.

### 7.2 Pinterest’s Approach
1. **Cross-Cluster Routing**: 
   - The gateway routes queries to whichever cluster is healthy or less loaded.
   - **Overflow** from scheduled to ad-hoc cluster if the scheduled cluster is busy (or vice versa), better utilizing idle capacity.
2. **Organization-based Resource Groups**: 
   - Each organization or team receives a resource quota.
   - If they exceed it, only that group’s queries are queued. 
   - Avoids “noisy neighbor” issues at a global level.

### 7.3 Example: Resource Group Configuration (Hypothetical)

```ini
# etc/trino/resource-groups.properties

root.groups=engineering,analytics,marketing

root.engineering.max-queued=100
root.engineering.max-running=20
root.engineering.scheduling-policy=weighted
root.engineering.query-priority=HIGH

root.analytics.max-queued=200
root.analytics.max-running=30

root.marketing.max-queued=100
root.marketing.max-running=10
```

In practice, Pinterest’s approach is more dynamic and driven by an internal service, but conceptually resembles the above.

## 8. Bridging the Gap with Spark SQL

### 8.1 User Pattern at Pinterest
1. **Prototype** in Trino: developers love interactive speed and simpler SQL transformations.
2. **Production** in Spark: especially for large-scale or memory-intensive ETL with better built-in fault tolerance and batch scheduling.

### 8.2 Automatic Translation
- Pinterest explored a **Trino Plan → Calcite IR → Spark SQL** translation layer.
- This helps convert a stable Trino query into a Spark job for large scheduled pipelines.
- **Challenge**: Maintaining correct semantics, complex SQL features, plus user-defined functions. 
- Also investigating new Trino features (like the **Project Tardigrade** for fault tolerance and large-scale ETL).

---

## 9. Future Plans

1. **Evaluate Graviton**: 
   - ARM-based AWS instances for potential cost savings and performance improvements.
2. **Enhanced Warnings**: 
   - More sophisticated detection of anti-patterns.
3. **Finish Fine-Grained Access Control**: 
   - Merge PII/non-PII clusters and unify permissions using token-based approach.
4. **UDF Support**:
   - Streamline user-defined function creation and deployment in Trino.
5. **Unified Query Service**:
   - Possibly a single user interface that can direct queries to Trino or Spark as needed—behind the scenes—removing confusion and complexity for end users.
6. **Fault Tolerance / Tardigrade**:
   - Evaluate improvements in Trino’s fault tolerance for large ETL or batch queries that were historically done in Spark.

│Use STS creds to read/write only authorized data│
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
