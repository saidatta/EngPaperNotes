The `Lifecycle` class in Elasticsearch manages the lifecycle state of a component. It allows specific state transitions and provides methods to move to these states. The class is thread-safe and supports concurrent state transitions.

## Lifecycle States

The `Lifecycle` class defines four states:

- `INITIALIZED`: The initial state of a component.
- `STARTED`: The component is running.
- `STOPPED`: The component has been stopped but can be restarted.
- `CLOSED`: The component has been stopped and cannot be restarted.

## State Transitions

The `Lifecycle` class allows the following state transitions:

- `INITIALIZED` -> `STARTED`, `STOPPED`, `CLOSED`
- `STARTED` -> `STOPPED`
- `STOPPED` -> `STARTED`, `CLOSED`
- `CLOSED` -> (no transitions)

A component can also remain in the same state.

## Methods

The `Lifecycle` class provides several methods to check the current state and to move to a new state:

- `state()`: Returns the current state.
- `initialized()`, `started()`, `stopped()`, `closed()`: Return `true` if the component is in the corresponding state.
- `canMoveToStarted()`, `canMoveToStopped()`, `canMoveToClosed()`: Check if it's possible to move to the corresponding state. Throw an `IllegalStateException` if the transition is not allowed.
- `moveToStarted()`, `moveToStopped()`, `moveToClosed()`: Move to the corresponding state. Return `true` if the transition was successful. Throw an `IllegalStateException` if the transition is not allowed.

## Usage

The `Lifecycle` class is typically used in the `stop()` and `close()` methods of a component. The `moveTo...()` methods are used to perform the state transition, and the return value is used to determine if the transition was successful and if the stop or close logic should be executed.

## Notes

- The `Lifecycle` class is thread-safe. It's possible to prevent concurrent state transitions by locking on the `Lifecycle` object itself.
- The `close()` method can only be called when the component is in the `STOPPED` state. Therefore, it's necessary to stop the component before closing it.
- The `Lifecycle` class is part of the `org.elasticsearch.common.component` package.
