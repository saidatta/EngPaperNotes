### Introduction
This note provides a detailed analysis of the evolution from individual threads to thread pools. It includes code examples in Java and explores the underlying principles and benefits of using thread pools.

### From Thread to Thread Pool

#### What is a Thread Doing?
A thread is responsible for executing a function and then terminating. Let's start with a basic example in Java to illustrate this concept:

```java
public class Demo01 {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        var thread = new Thread(() -> {
            System.out.println("Hello world from a Java thread");
        });
        thread.start();
    }
}
```

This code snippet creates and starts a thread that prints a message. The same can be achieved using an anonymous inner class:

```java
public class Demo01 {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        var thread = new Thread(new Runnable() {
            @Override
            public void run() {
                System.out.println("Hello world from a Java thread");
            }
        });
        thread.start();
    }
}
```

In both cases, the thread executes the `run` method of a `Runnable` object. The Java thread constructor is as follows:

```java
public Thread(Runnable target) {
    this(null, target, "Thread-" + nextThreadNum(), 0);
}
```

When `start()` is called, it triggers the native `start0` method, which in turn calls the operating system's API to create a thread that executes the `run` method's bytecode and then exits.

#### The Lifecycle of a Thread
- **Creation**: A thread is created using the system's underlying functions.
- **Execution**: The thread executes the function provided to it.
- **Termination**: After executing the function, the thread exits and is recycled by the system.
In essence, a thread's role is to execute a function and then terminate.
### Why Do We Need a Thread Pool?

Creating and destroying threads frequently can be resource-intensive due to the need for system resources and context switching between user mode and kernel mode. This overhead can significantly impact performance, especially under high concurrency.

A thread pool addresses this issue by reusing a fixed number of threads to execute multiple tasks. This avoids the overhead of creating and destroying threads repeatedly.
### Thread Pool Implementation Principle
#### Key Points
1. **A thread executes a function**.
2. **Threads in the thread pool can execute many functions but will not exit**.

These principles can be achieved by using a loop within the thread to continuously fetch and execute tasks from a task queue until instructed to stop.

#### Sample Code
The following code snippet demonstrates the basic structure of a thread pool thread:

```java
public class ThreadPoolThread extends Thread {
    private BlockingQueue<Runnable> taskQueue;
    private boolean isStopped = false;

    public ThreadPoolThread(BlockingQueue<Runnable> queue) {
        taskQueue = queue;
    }

    public void run() {
        while (!isStopped) {
            try {
                Runnable task = taskQueue.take();
                task.run();
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                // do nothing
            }
        }
    }

    public synchronized void stopThread() {
        isStopped = true;
        this.interrupt(); // Break the thread out of the blocking queue wait.
    }
}
```

This thread continuously takes tasks from a blocking queue and executes them. It stops only when `isStopped` is set to true.

### Details of Thread Pool Implementation

#### Concurrent and Safe Blocking Queue
A thread pool requires a thread-safe queue to hold the tasks. The `BlockingQueue` interface in Java provides a suitable structure.

#### Ensuring All Threads Exit Normally
To ensure that threads exit normally, a flag (e.g., `isStopped`) can be used to indicate when the thread should stop. The thread checks this flag regularly and exits the loop when the flag is set.

## Thread Pool Usage and Analysis

### Preface
In Java, thread pools are a widely used concurrent framework. They are essential for executing tasks asynchronously or concurrently. Proper use of thread pools can provide several benefits:

1. **Reduce Resource Consumption**: By reusing threads, thread creation and destruction costs are minimized.
2. **Improve Response Speed**: Tasks can be executed immediately without waiting for thread creation.
3. **Improve Thread Manageability**: Threads are scarce resources; uncontrolled creation can deplete resources and reduce system stability. A thread pool allows for unified allocation, tuning, and monitoring.

### 1. Implementation Principle of Thread Pool

The processing flow of a thread pool is illustrated as follows:

#### Thread Pool States
The `ctl` field in the thread pool represents its current state. It is an `AtomicInteger` encapsulating two fields: `workerCount` (number of valid threads) and `runState` (whether it is running, shutting down, etc.). The state transitions are:
- **RUNNING**: Accepts new tasks and processes queued tasks.
- **SHUTDOWN**: Does not accept new tasks but processes queued tasks.
- **STOP**: Does not accept new tasks, does not process queued tasks, and interrupts ongoing tasks.
- **TIDYING**: All tasks have terminated, `workerCount` is zero, and the thread transitions to the `terminate()` method.
- **TERMINATED**: `terminate()` method execution is completed.
![[Screenshot 2024-05-08 at 2.08.52 PM.png]]
The state transitions:
- `RUNNING` -> `SHUTDOWN` when `shutdown()` is called.
- `(RUNNING or SHUTDOWN)` -> `STOP` when `shutdownNow()` is called.
- `SHUTDOWN` -> `TIDYING` when both the queue and thread pool are empty.
- `STOP` -> `TIDYING` when the thread pool is empty.
- `TIDYING` -> `TERMINATED` when the `terminate()` method completes.

#### Execution Process
There are four scenarios when using the `execute()` method to submit tasks to the thread pool:

1. **Thread Count < corePoolSize**: A new thread is created to execute the task.
2. **Thread Count â‰¥ corePoolSize**: The task is added to the blocking queue.
3. **Queue Full**: A new thread is created to process the task (requiring a global lock).
4. **Thread Count Exceeds maximumPoolSize**: The thread pool rejects the task, calling the `RejectedExecutionHandler.rejectedExecution()` method.

#### Source Code Analysis
```java
public void execute(Runnable command) {
    if (command == null)
        throw new NullPointerException();
    int c = ctl.get();
    if (workerCountOf(c) < corePoolSize) {
        if (addWorker(command, true))
            return;
        c = ctl.get();
    }
    if (isRunning(c) && workQueue.offer(command)) {
        int recheck = ctl.get();
        if (!isRunning(recheck) && remove(command))
            reject(command);
        else if (workerCountOf(recheck) == 0)
            addWorker(null, false);
    } else if (!addWorker(command, false))
        reject(command);
}
```

### 2. Creation and Use of Thread Pool

#### Core Parameters
1. **corePoolSize**: Minimum number of threads kept in the pool, even if they are idle.
2. **runnableTaskQueue**: A blocking queue to hold tasks before they are executed.
   - **ArrayBlockingQueue**: Fixed size, FIFO order.
   - **LinkedBlockingQueue**: Variable size, FIFO order.
   - **SynchronousQueue**: Direct handoff, no queue.
   - **PriorityBlockingQueue**: Priority order.
3. **maximumPoolSize**: Maximum number of threads allowed in the pool.
4. **RejectedExecutionHandler**: Strategy for handling tasks that cannot be executed immediately.
   - **AbortPolicy**: Throws an exception.
   - **CallerRunsPolicy**: Executes the task in the caller's thread.
   - **DiscardOldestPolicy**: Discards the oldest task.
   - **DiscardPolicy**: Discards the task silently.
5. **keepAliveTime**: Time for which threads can remain idle before being terminated.
6. **TimeUnit**: Unit of time for keepAliveTime.
7. **ThreadFactory**: Factory to create new threads.

#### Creating a Thread Pool

1. **Using Executors Factory Class**
   - **Single-Threaded Pool**:
     ```java
     public static ExecutorService newSingleThreadExecutor() {
         return new FinalizableDelegatedExecutorService(
             new ThreadPoolExecutor(1, 1, 0L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new LinkedBlockingQueue<Runnable>())
         );
     }
     ```
   - **Fixed-Thread Pool**:
     ```java
     public static ExecutorService newFixedThreadPool(int nThreads) {
         return new ThreadPoolExecutor(nThreads, nThreads, 0L, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS, new LinkedBlockingQueue<Runnable>());
     }
     ```
   - **Cacheable Thread Pool**:
     ```java
     public static ExecutorService newCachedThreadPool() {
         return new ThreadPoolExecutor(0, Integer.MAX_VALUE, 60L, TimeUnit.SECONDS, new SynchronousQueue<Runnable>());
     }
     ```

2. **Custom Thread Pool Creation**
   ```java
   public ThreadPoolExecutor(int corePoolSize, int maximumPoolSize, long keepAliveTime, TimeUnit unit, BlockingQueue<Runnable> workQueue) {
       this(corePoolSize, maximumPoolSize, keepAliveTime, unit, workQueue, Executors.defaultThreadFactory(), defaultHandler);
   }
   ```

#### Submitting Tasks to the Thread Pool

1. **Using `execute()` Method**: Submits tasks that do not return a value.
   ```java
   public static void main(String[] args) {
       ...
       threadPool.execute(new Runnable {
           public void run() {
               // do something...
           }
       });
       ...
   }
   ```

2. **Using `submit()` Method**: Submits tasks that return a value.
   ```java
   public static void main(String[] args) {
       ...
       Future<Object> future = threadPool.submit(handleTask);
       try {
           Object res = future.get();
       } catch (InterruptedException e) {
           // handle interruption
       } catch (ExecutionException e) {
           // handle execution exception
       } finally {
           threadPool.shutdown();
       }
       ...
   }
   ```

#### Shutting Down the Thread Pool
- **shutdown()**: Initiates an orderly shutdown.
  ```java
  public void shutdown() {
      final ReentrantLock mainLock = this.mainLock;
      mainLock.lock();
      try {
          checkShutdownAccess();
          advanceRunState(SHUTDOWN);
          interruptIdleWorkers();
          onShutdown();
      } finally {
          mainLock.unlock();
      }
      tryTerminate();
  }
  ```

- **shutdownNow()**: Attempts to stop all actively executing tasks and halts the processing of waiting tasks.
  ```java
  public List<Runnable> shutdownNow() {
      List<Runnable> tasks;
      final ReentrantLock mainLock = this.mainLock;
      mainLock.lock();
      try {
          checkShutdownAccess();
          advanceRunState(STOP);
          interruptWorkers();
          tasks = drainQueue();
      } finally {
          mainLock.unlock();
      }
      tryTerminate();
      return tasks;
  }
  ```

### 3. Recommended Thread Pool Parameter Settings

#### Task-Based Reference

- **CPU-Bound Tasks**: Number of threads = Number of CPU cores + 1.
- **IO-Bound Tasks**: Number of threads = 2 * Number of CPU cores + 1.

#### Ideal State Evaluation Based on Number of Tasks

1. **Default Values**:
   ```java
   corePoolSize = 1
   queueCapacity = Integer.MAX_VALUE
   maxPoolSize = Integer.MAX_VALUE
   keepAliveTime = 60s
   allowCoreThreadTimeout = false
   rejectedExecutionHandler = AbortPolicy()
   ```

2. **Task-Based Calculation**:
   - **corePoolSize**: Based on task frequency and duration.
     ```java
     corePoolSize = tasksPerSecond * taskDuration
     ```
   - **queueCapacity**:
     ```java
     queueCapacity = (corePoolSize / taskDuration) * maxResponseTime
     ```
   - **maxPoolSize**:
     ```java
     maxPoolSize = (maxTasks - queueCapacity) / taskCapacity
     ```

### 4. Recommended Thread Pool Usage Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Asynchronous Processing
- **Create Thread Pool**:
  ```java
  @Bean
  public ThreadPoolTaskExecutor asyncExecutorPool() {
      ThreadPoolTaskExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolTaskExecutor();
      executor.setCorePoolSize(20);
      executor.setMaxPoolSize(100);
      executor.setQueueCapacity(500);
      executor.setWaitForTasksToCompleteOnShutdown(true);
      executor.setAwaitTerminationSeconds(60);
      executor.setThreadNamePrefix("test-async-thread-");
      executor.setRejectedExecutionHandler(new ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy());
      executor.initialize();
      return executor;
  }
  ```

- **Use @Async Annotation**:
  ```java
  @Async("asyncExecutorPool")
  public void processTask1() {
      // do something...
  }
  ```

#### Scenario 2: Ordered Execution
- **Single-Threaded Pool**:
  ```java
  public class SingleExecutorTest {
      private HashMap<Long, ThreadPoolExecutor> executorMap = new HashMap<>();

      public void init

() {
          for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
              ThreadPoolExecutor threadPoolExecutor = new ThreadPoolExecutor(1, 1, 0L, TimeUnit.SECONDS, new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(1000));
              threadPoolExecutor.setRejectedExecutionHandler(new ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardPolicy());
              ThreadFactory threadFactory = new CustomizableThreadFactory("testSingle-" + i + "-");
              threadPoolExecutor.setThreadFactory(threadFactory);
              executorMap.put(Long.valueOf(i), threadPoolExecutor);
          }
      }

      public void processTask() {
          ThreadPoolExecutor executor = executorMap.get(Long.valueOf(id % 5));
          executor.submit(() -> {
              // do something...
          });
      }
  }
  ```
