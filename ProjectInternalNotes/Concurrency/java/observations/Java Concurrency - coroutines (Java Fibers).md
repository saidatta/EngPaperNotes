## Introduction
Coroutines, known as Fibers in Java Project Loom, provide a lightweight, efficient alternative to threads. They introduce a new layer of abstraction, allowing for millions of fibers to run on a limited number of threads without overwhelming the JVM. The ability to pause and resume fibers allows for efficient use of threads, reducing the time spent in idle or waiting states. 

Let's take an example. Suppose you need to fetch 100,000 products from an external website, update their prices, and store them in a database. Traditionally, you might employ a fixed thread pool or a cached thread pool. But these solutions come with challenges, like blocked or idle CPU, excessive memory consumption, or the risk of running out of memory when too many threads are created. An alternative is to use reactive programming, but this requires learning new APIs and can make your code harder to read and debug.

Java Fibers aims to address these challenges. In the following sections, we'll cover the problem in more detail, explore how fibers work, and show how to use them in code.

## The Problem with Traditional Thread Pools
Suppose you decide to use a fixed thread pool of 10 threads for fetching and processing 100,000 products. When a thread tries to fetch a product (an I/O operation), it has to wait for the response from the external website, and the thread enters a waiting state. After receiving the product data and updating the price (a CPU operation), the thread can run without waiting or blocking. But when it tries to save the data into the database (another I/O operation), it enters a waiting state again.

In summary, the thread is blocked during I/O operations and running during CPU operations. The problem here is that while waiting for an I/O operation to complete, the CPU is idle. This is an inefficient use of resources.

If you switch to a cached thread pool to avoid this problem, the thread pool will keep creating new threads while others are blocked. However, each thread takes around 1MB of memory. If you create thousands of threads, your application could consume a lot of memory and crash due to an out-of-memory exception.

## Reactive Programming: A Callback-Based Approach
Reactive programming is another approach to solve this problem. Instead of waiting for I/O operations to complete, you ask the reactive framework to call a method (a callback) when the operation completes. While this method can make better use of CPU and memory resources, it requires learning a new set of APIs and makes the code harder to read and debug.

## Java Fibers: A Solution
Java Fibers introduce a new layer of abstraction by separating the concept of task from thread. The key to their efficiency is the ability to "mount" and "unmount" tasks to and from threads. When a task reaches a blocking operation, such as an I/O operation or lock acquisition, it's unmounted from the thread, which can then take on another task. The task's state is saved so it can be resumed later.

When the blocking operation completes, the task can proceed with its next operations. The Java Fiber Scheduler finds a free thread, mounts the task on it, and the task continues from where it left off. This mechanism is much more efficient than having a thread wait for an I/O operation to complete.

These tasks are known as coroutines or, in Java, fibers. The Java Fiber Scheduler is responsible for efficiently assigning fibers to threads.

## Code Example
The exact API for using fibers is not yet finalized, but it might look something like this:

```java
Fiber.schedule(() -> {
    // Task to run
});
```

In this example, `Fiber.schedule()` is

 a static method that takes a `Runnable` as an argument. This is similar to submitting a task to an `ExecutorService`.

## Advantages of Java Fibers Over Threads
- **Lightweight**: Fibers consume only a few bytes to a few kilobytes of memory, compared to the 1MB stack allocated for a thread.
- **Non-blocking**: By unmounting tasks during blocking operations, fibers keep the underlying thread from blocking.
- **Uses existing APIs**: Unlike reactive programming, you can use the familiar APIs to write your code.
- **Handled by the Java Fiber Scheduler**: The scheduling over the kernel or native threads is taken care of by the Java Fiber Scheduler, so you don't have to manage it yourself.
- **Allows for more concurrent operations**: You can run millions of fibers in an application without overwhelming the JVM, enabling your web servers to handle hundreds of thousands of concurrent connections at a time.

## Similar Concepts in Other Languages
Coroutines are not exclusive to Java. Kotlin also supports them and is fully compatible with Java. Python has the asyncio library, and Go has goroutines.

## Conclusion
Java Fibers, or coroutines, represent a significant advancement in concurrent programming. They are lightweight and efficient, allowing developers to write non-blocking code while maintaining the use of familiar APIs. However, as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, Java Fibers is not yet officially released. If you wish to use similar features today, consider using Kotlin or other languages with coroutine support.
