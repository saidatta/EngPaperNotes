CyclicBarrier is a crucial concurrency utility in Java that facilitates the coordination of multiple threads, ensuring they wait for each other to reach a common barrier point before proceeding. This detailed analysis covers its implementation, constructors, core methods, and practical usage.
## Constructors
### With Callback Method
```java
public CyclicBarrier(int parties, Runnable barrierAction) {
    if (parties <= 0) throw new IllegalArgumentException();
    this.parties = parties;
    this.count = parties;
    this.barrierCommand = barrierAction;
}
```
- **`parties`**: Number of threads required to trigger the barrier.
- **`barrierAction`**: Optional callback executed when the barrier is triggered.
### Without Callback Function
```java
public CyclicBarrier(int parties) {
    this(parties, null);
}
```
- Simplified constructor for when no action is needed upon barrier completion.
## Core Methods
### `await()`
Blocks until all parties have called `await` on this barrier.

```java
public int await() throws InterruptedException, BrokenBarrierException {
    try {
        return dowait(false, 0L);
    } catch (TimeoutException toe) {
        throw new Error(toe); // cannot happen
    }
}
```

- **Exceptions**: `InterruptedException` if the current thread was interrupted while waiting, `BrokenBarrierException` if another thread was interrupted or timed out while the current thread was waiting.

### `await(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)`

Allows threads to wait for each other for a specified time before proceeding or timing out.

```java
public int await(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)
    throws InterruptedException, BrokenBarrierException, TimeoutException {
    return dowait(true, unit.toNanos(timeout));
}
```

- **Parameters**:
    - `timeout`: The maximum time to wait.
    - `unit`: The time unit of the `timeout` argument.

### `dowait(boolean timed, long nanos)`

The primary logic for waiting threads, handling interruptions, and executing the barrier action.

- **Key Operations**:
    - Locking mechanism to ensure thread safety.
    - Checks for broken barrier or interruptions.
    - Decrements the count and checks if current thread is the last to arrive.
    - If last, executes the optional barrier action, resets the barrier, and continues.
    - Otherwise, waits (potentially with timeout) for the barrier to trip.

### `breakBarrier()`

Marks the barrier as broken and notifies all waiting threads.

```java
private void breakBarrier() {
    generation.broken = true;
    count = parties;
    trip.signalAll();
}
```

## Supporting Methods

### `getNumberWaiting()`

Returns the number of threads currently waiting at the barrier.

### `reset()`

Resets the barrier to its initial state.

### `isBroken()`

Checks if the barrier is in a broken state.

### `getParties()`

Returns the number of parties required to trip the barrier.

## Practical Usage Example

Demonstrates creating a `CyclicBarrier` for five threads, with a callback action printing a message when all threads reach the barrier.

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    final int THREAD_COUNT = 5;
    CyclicBarrier barrier = new CyclicBarrier(THREAD_COUNT, () -> {
        System.out.println("All threads have reached the barrier");
    });

    for (int i = 0; i < THREAD_COUNT; i++) {
        new Thread(() -> {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is waiting at the barrier");
            try {
                barrier.await();
            } catch (InterruptedException | BrokenBarrierException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " has passed the barrier");
        }).start();
    }
}
```
