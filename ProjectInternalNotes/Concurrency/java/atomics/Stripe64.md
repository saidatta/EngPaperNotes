The `Striped64` class in Java is an abstract class that is used for creating atomic variables, like `LongAdder` and `DoubleAdder`. It manages a dynamically growing array of these atomic variables in a way that minimizes contention when multiple threads are trying to update the value.

In simple terms, `Striped64` uses an internal array of `Cell` objects, each of which holds a piece of the total sum. If multiple threads try to update the sum simultaneously, instead of each thread trying to update a single shared variable (which would require a lot of waiting), each thread updates a different `Cell` object in the array. This can dramatically improve performance when there is a high amount of contention.

It achieves this by using a few key mechanisms:

-   It uses a hash of the current thread to determine which `Cell` to update. This ensures that different threads are likely to update different `Cell` objects, reducing contention.
-   The array of `Cell` objects is lazily initialized and can grow dynamically as needed. This allows it to adapt to the level of contention and minimize memory usage when contention is low.
-   When a thread tries to update a `Cell` but finds that it is already being updated by another thread (a "collision"), it can either try to update a different `Cell` or double the size of the array to reduce future collisions.
-   It uses padding around the `Cell` objects to ensure that they don't end up in the same cache line, which can dramatically improve performance on modern CPUs.

In conclusion, `Striped64` provides the low-level functionality needed to build atomic variables that can be efficiently updated by many threads at once. However, as a user, you would typically use higher-level classes like `LongAdder` or `DoubleAdder`, which are built on top of `Striped64`, rather than using `Striped64` directly.
